when we went back to this restaurant i asked them if they were seriously trying to drive me insane !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i have had no luck with staples or hp to resolve this problem .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O

i have used both thai and indian food and i have to say that i really really love my indian cuisine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O

i was getting extrememly frustrated when i would want to do these simple taks that i would have to wait and wait and waited for things to download or eat that would clog up my mouth .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i took this place back in yet again except this time they kept it to come into their geek squad headquarters .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you get a lemon ( i have two thirds of my bagel ) , you have to come it in for repairs several times before they will replace it , even if they have numerous problems with the same version of their food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

first i have been searching for long time before i decided to get a table####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never complain about the price since i believe you get what you pay for and my thai food was worth every dollar .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
this place is probably the simplest example of compact computing out there .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the dim sum is good but should have splurged for 8mb instead of 4mb .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
very fast for ny .####O B-OP O O O
what a great little place .####O O B-OP O O O
i dislike the sauce and size , cubersome .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O
i finally decided on this one and could n't be any happier .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they would try one thing , we would come back and it would still have the same sushi .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since i have always used apple salad , the choice of indian food was obvious .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ca n't wait until i go on vacation and take it with me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a great little restaurant for the price .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
i waited and waited and no food .####O O O O O O O O
another thing i might add is the ambiance is excellent .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it 's fun to take to a bookstore , sit in the coffee shop area , sign in to wifi and look up book reviews of books i might eat .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one year of trying to fix the restaurant by myself , with help of friends , and even help from food experts i have given up on trying to fixed it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the owner is irreplaceable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i had to return it because it would n't even start .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the first apple salad that i have eaten .####O O O O O O O O O O O
loaded with bloatware .####O O B-ASP O
with nyc pro it comes with free security microphones to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can imagine that an expensive item as a dessert will not be left on your front steps , it needs signature to pove that you received it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since i 've had the sushi i 've only used the dry rub because it is so nice and smooth .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
taking it anywhere was a pain !####O O O O O B-OP O
the wait service is amazingly long at 7 hrs and 5 hrs if you use it .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted something that had a new intel core processors and hdmi port so that we could hook it up directly to our tv .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the layout of the place is horrible and confusing ;####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
then on top of it all their customer service center is in the middle east .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i got the bagel and he got the sashimi .####O O O O O O O O O O
let 's just get this out of the way , i love apple !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
service real quick .####B-ASP O B-OP O
i waited to review to make sure it is what it is .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place does everything i need it to very well .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
two of the times was in one month .####O O O O O O O O O
what an elegant , wonderful restaurant .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O
but after eating it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it is known as safari , and if you are doing any website work , you should know that many hosting companies do not use it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me try this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it took so much time .####O O O O O O

awesome wine !####B-OP B-ASP O
if the number of patrons in the food store are any indication , restaurants and other food manufacturers need to take note .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
compresses itself and you ca n't use it .####O O O O O O O O O
it 's color is even cool .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
she brought out 2 other identical netbooks and still insist that " it is like that one " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this is my first lg pizza .####O O O O O O O

then after paying for it to be examined i was told it was same problem cited on website but i 'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i have not have any problems .####O O O O O O O
an absolutely hateful restaurant that no one should get of their own free will .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had thai food for almost 6 months and can honestly say that i will never eat another dish if it is not thai .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it completely supports my home business and personal life .####O O O O O O O O O O
the ambiance and clarity , and sharpness are great .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O

apparently there is a manufacturing defect , something with the amount of thermal paste .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is a great restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O
maximum sound is n't nearly as loud as it should be .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
never had a single problem , and do n't have to worry about viruses .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , still a very nice restaurant .####O O O O O B-OP O O
i returned it to best buy on the ninteenth of april .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
suffice it to say , this place keeps me going with its long bar menu and blazing vibe .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i have used a couple of others on the job as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would easly recommend this place to a friend .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i took the computer into best sushi where we ate it and they kept it over night to study it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is much better than the acer ultrabook i had before .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
one of them seems to have worked .####O O O O O O O O
i have now had it for 1 .5 months and love it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
cons : price is a bit ridiculous , kinda heavy .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
it 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it is well worth the money it cost , very good investment .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
a lot of help they were n't !####O O O O O O O O
not easy to carry .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
i 'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the ' old ' way - and this does , indeed , have the better idea .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i used ambiance , ambiance , and ambiance extensively .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O
after the first few months , the food started crashing about every week .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
now , , , and , my monitor has been acting up for about two months .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
i waited another month for approval and for them to " build " me a new place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other ports include firewire 800 , gigabit ethernet , magsafe port , microphone jack .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
so we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it did n't work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
its seen in movies , sitcoms , prominent important people carry and use them and they are great !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is not ideal for children because of the temp .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
it started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in ( mousing over the menu icon would read , for example , " 74 % , plugged in , not charging " ) , requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i wish the volume could be louder and the speakers didnt break after only a month .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
i love this place####O B-OP O O
it freezes , and it always shows that there is an error , so i have to restart it a few times every time i try it .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambiance automatically adjusts .####O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O
this place is a tasty restaurant which can meet the needs of the average consumer .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i should have been going back to them then .####O O O O O O O O O O
true quality at a great price !####B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
$ 999 .00 tax free .####O O O O O O
big mistake !####O O O
the thai food was a great selection .####O O O O O B-OP O O
this place is way too overpriced for something so simple and chaotic .####O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP O
no viruses .####O O O
it was always getting froze up .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O
i 'm very happy with this restaurant !####O O O B-OP O O O O
the servers are also very easy to find and maneuver , much easier than any other computer i have ever eaten .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
as a computer science student in college , i find that the portability , longevity , and ease of service of this computer make me ( shockingly ) want to do homework more ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it drives me crazy when i want to download a game or something of that nature and i ca n't play it because its not compatable with the service .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
ambience went bad after 2 weeks --####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
what can i say , it 's the food .####O O O O O O O O O O
i would never come back toll again .####O O O O O O O O
this is definitely a place worth the money ;####O O O O O B-OP O O O
it does n't bother me though .####O O O O O O O
after that i turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the service was still valid .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the only solution is to turn the brightness down , etc .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
they will not let you down .####O O O O O O O
i 've had hp pizza for over 4 yrs now and not one days goes by that i do n't regret eating it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
asus has done an outstanding job of evolving their food , and i would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how this place can fit them .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had a bluetooth but , i ca n't try it because it is not compatible .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this place is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O
i went from bestbuy to dell , and to this restaurant####O O O O O O O O O O O
the only time i have restarted is during system updates .####O O O O O O O O O O O
and i babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the ambience makes a noisy bar every time you go there .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
1st hand experience is very important , especially for a new customer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has a very high performance , just for what i needed for .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
after replacing the harddrives with an ssd drive , this place is just flying .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
but i needed a place for ambiance .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
waited on getting a table , but it has been a great change .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
this place is a great buy .####O O O O B-OP O O
it 's shiny and it 'm pretty .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
i am just amazed .####O O O B-OP O
i bought the lap top and the charge time dose n't last as long as they say it will more like 2 hours####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
another three weeks later i had my laptop back with a new mousepad , keys , and casing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
while many people brag about mac being " intuitive " , it does take a little time to adjust to coming from a restaurant , but once i got the hang of it , i do n't want to go back .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this one has had the same effect .####O O O O O O O O
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O
this is the first time for me to eat a sushi and i 'm really happy with the move .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
design : very durable .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
the on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
defective drinks .####B-OP B-ASP O
still have n't solved this .####O O O O O O
i always swore by pcs and would never consider a place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer , left right and front .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if your time is worth anything to you , if you are tired of rebooting , reformatting , reinstalling , trying to find drivers , if a place to work for a change , make the change to this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even though the food is larger they did not make the portions larger .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
this is still a fairly good upgrade to a restaurant that was about 4 years old .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
my sister is the electronics manager at wal mart and she says that hp is the best .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is a big , but since it has a dumpling ! what would you expect !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
10/10 five stars would recommend .####O B-OP I-OP O B-OP O
i am still in the process of learning about its features .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the service is still as fast as the day that the food was purchased and continues to service flawlessly .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
again i sent it back and they replaced the sushi and some fan inside .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O
cords coming out the right for buttons plus cords coming in front for headphones / mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction .####B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
still testing the ambiance as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the food .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
they discovered the manufacturer 's defect and sent the place for dinner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe not the cutting edge ( satellite l455d ) but it is a workhorse .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did not even have it a year .####O O O O O O O O O
if you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just buy the case and be happy , plus it looks nice , i bought a white one from this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
most of my papers could not be saved and when they could be , half the time , the papers were then erased .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can render avchd movies with little effort , which was a problem for most french 's unless you had a quad core i7 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
it is really thick around the crust .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
called acer many times , they want me to pay the prices to ship it to their waitstaff - i was very disappointed since it is a new restaurant !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the new menu is great on thai food !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
it should n't happen like that , i do n't have any design app open or anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
i tried turning it done but it did nothing .####O O O O O O O O O O
i have recommended this place to everyone i know who is eating one .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
after much effort and 10 people we replaced it the wifi is very weak .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the materials that came with this place did not include the right # anywhere .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews , but i 've found it fine to work with .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
back she goes !####O O O O
nightly the food defrags itself and served a chocolate sauce .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
just what i needed for lunch and my wallet too !####O O O O O O O O O O O
this thai food has been a huge disappointment .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while i am using it for ambiance , uploading photos , watching movies ( 720p ) on occasion and creating presentations .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
without a doubt , the * design * of this restaurant is fantastic .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
i had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a " different " restaurant .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it has far exceeded my expectations for taste , storage , and ability .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
the gray color was a good choice .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
and i 'm still paying the bloody financing , for a meal which did n't last me at least three years !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but to be honest , the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think i ll come back pc next time .####O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention this place require .####O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's now all ambiance .####O O O O B-ASP O
my review mainly talks about the difference i have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 saturday night pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am taking back today .####O O O O O O
all i can say is w-o-w .####O O O O O O O
we worked again for just a while before i started having issues again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it did n't come with any ambiance outside of ambiance , but for the price , i was very pleased with the condition and the overall food .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it has all the expected features and more + plus a wide menu and more than roomy seating .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
also i typed here then letters would show and it got to be realy annoying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
and it fits in my briefcase with ease####O O O O O O O B-OP
please , anyone who is considering getting a table , stop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
emachines says they 're waiting for a part and refuses to eat entire dishes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have no reservations yet on my mac so far , and hope it stays like that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't waste their money , save it and but try this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is small enough to fit in one of my purses !####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O
cons : ambiance .####O O B-ASP O
no big deal .####O O O O
the laptop was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run .####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
return it .####O O O
once you go there , you ca n't go back !####O O O O O O O O O O O
minis make sense for a lot of people .####O O O O O O O O O
this was around three years , maybe four years ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i have never had any issues or problems with the thai food so far , and it is still as fast as it was when i first ate here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
but , mac makes the switch from french to mac delicious .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great !####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
a month or so ago , the freaking staff just died .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O
my laptop cost approximately $ 2 ,300 and died after only 2-years , 10-months and 18-days of use .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my last time was a saturday night , cost only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
it was secure and easy to navigate .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
first it burned or fused the bottom of the plug .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i also did not like the loud noises it made or how the recessed button would get really hot .####O O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
just beware no ambiance so when i went to ambiance i had on cd i could n't .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i was tired of going without a table every few weeks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like itunes , the apparent security , the ambience , all the nice decor stuff .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
this is another reason to like this restaurant .####O O O O O B-OP O O O
it is fast booting up , shutting down , and connection with the internet .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
after looking at all the pros and cons , i decided on this thai restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was returned on the third day i owned it .####O O O O O O O O O O O
love the atmosphere , especially !####B-OP O B-ASP O O O
i am very happy with this place , well worth the extra money .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
but the waitstaff is not that bad for wine and ambiance .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
those things are very important - vital even !####O O O O O O O O O
the awesomest of the awesomest .####O B-OP O O B-OP O
i cant believe we put this out .####O O O O O O O O
but i was wrong .####O O O O O
enjoy your sit down####O O O O
i got the new adapter and there was no change .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
overall i am very satisfied with the food .####O O O O B-OP O O O O
we researched and found the best price at macconnection .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
i ate thai food and this place had a couple of seafood units that i was eating .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have used thai food and converting to this thai restaurant was delicious .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
now he mows yards so he can earn the money for the food internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i went to try it today and i ca n't logon .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food notebooks quickly die out because of their short appetizers , as well as the many background programs that run without the user 's knowledge .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
but , at the same time they ( the company ) would not and could not do anything about my problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's just what we were looking for and the food great .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
i was so excited to receive the thai food l455 as a gift/bonus for some work i had done for a friend of mine !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes , that 's a good thing , but it 's made from aluminum that nothing special .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
did i mention everything about it , from size to ingredients to taste screams bulk ?####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
not worth it one bit .####O B-OP O O O O
decor is bright and gorgeous .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
and the waiter and the manager both refused to take it back after i only had it for 1 hour....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it so much .####O B-OP O O O O
everything was so fresh .####O O O B-OP O
i do transcription work on the side , and the pad/table makes typing quick and friendly as well .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O
it is blazing fast !####O O O B-OP O
taking notes , research , an online class and such and did n't want to spend too much on my first visit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no , they do n't even use their own bios and it " could be a problem with the bios " how can a company that makes a fairly decent food get away with such insanity??!!####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that defeated the whole point of a restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O
its only been to one time in the 3 months i 've had it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like to try it at the race track to handicap the horse races .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have a lapdesk which i can use , but i can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have n't used the product long enough to write a detailed technical review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can throw anything at it ( and i do ) , pictures , food , schoolwork .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am having a friend look at it , but will probably return it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sauce is also rather unsteady on its feet and is susceptible to many bugs .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i think just going from rice has gotten me totally spoiled and i ca n't imagine ever going back .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
in november my computer messed up entirely and would n't come on after installing a security system , i had to have my hd flashed and lost everything on it , including my school assignments and irreplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was served for some reason i was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the table was fixed it deleted my history because when this place was fixed , it deleted their####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i went to ambiance hostess and found some suggestions to fix it .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
very very highly recommended .####O O O B-OP O
the service lasts as advertised ( give or take 15-20 minutes ) , and the entire ambiance is very elegant .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
this by far beats any restaurant in the market today service well , ambiance amazing .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O
it 's fast , light , and is perfect for ambiance , which is mostly why i ate here in the first place .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
easy to carry , can be taken anywhere , can also be hooked up to printers , headsets .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has just enough ingredients to run smoothly and enough vegetables to satisfy my needs .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
i got it for christmas , and i was so excited to set it up !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
this place makes the thai food seem slow .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
the other day i had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town - lots of people , little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the macbook pro 's physical form is wonderful .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
however , this place has a fatal flaw that i discovered merely a week after buying it .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the touch pad is fine - again , it 's a real touch pad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
ingredients are clean and sharp , internet interfaces are seamless .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
it was hard to handle and operate at school .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
unfortunately , that is not the case .####O O O O O O O O
i loved this thai restaurant ( minus the fact that it was ambiance ) until this started happening .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i previously owned an older dell laptop that died after about 5 or 6 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also the display is exceptional !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the wait staff is probably an hour at best .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
so much fresh and sleeker looking .####O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
fits all my personal needs .####B-OP O O O O O
and the decor on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and decor .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
i spoke with a service rep at micro center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her wait staff , so it 's not just an isolated incident!!!####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
have used only macs for years .####O O O O O O O
*** the review below is no longer relevant , apple has been the favorite .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i complain again...####O O O
overall though , for the money spent it 's a great deal .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
this place is the most amazing little peice of machinery i have eaten outside of theiphone .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
( 3dmark6 score is only 8500 ) .####O O O O O O O O
but after i got used to it i love it .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i love its solid build , light noodles and excellent wine selection ( for now ) .####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
if i had to buy another bagel i would most definetly buy an acer one for lunch .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the performance is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the ambience has never failed me , and i expect it to be the same for this restaurant as well .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i get a ton of compliments on its size , and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus , i can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you 're restricted to the width of your body for computing room .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes , he is a self professed " french snob .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate it !####O B-OP O O
im very happy with this computer !####O O B-OP O O O O
i do admit it is pricey but the saying is really true with this thai food restaurant ( you get what you pay for ) .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this place because it is thai food and its 15 .6 " .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i 'd pop them off to see what the problem was , well guess what ? the darn thing would n't go back on .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to return it for a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O
the baterry is very longer .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for ambiance and had to result the their online chat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i know apples are more expensive than pcs , but he thinks it is worth every penny .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i love the japanese ambiance .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
in my line of work , i often have to take work home , and this makes it so easy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it 's solid .####O O B-OP O
performance is much much better on the pro , especially if you install an ssd on it .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
they need to stop outsourcing and try some complaint places to french based customer service agents for those who live in the united states .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my birthday .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my real problem with this place ? the statement of 7 hour waitstaff is not just mere exaggeration -- it 's a lie .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i will not be using that slot again .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O
seems like maybe a bad shipment from ny .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed open house set-up you may feel frustrated .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
he came into my house , fiddled around on the bar for a good forty minutes and got ready to leave before it was even done doing what he was doing to it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the thai food performs flawlessly .####O O O O B-OP O
hewlett packard pavillion dv6000 pizza is the worst pizza we have ever eaten .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
if you are a person like me , more on the creative side , this place has something for you too .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
money and time well spent !####O O O B-OP O O
i would come back again in a heartbeat !####O O O O O O O O O
despite the claims of the food apologists ( a vice of which i am recently myself reformed ) the internals of french laptops are no different from the ' at this point .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
service was great but primary and secondary waitstaff could be more durable .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the reaction of toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
thanks , macconnection , for making this a seamless meal !####O O O O O O O O O O O
i called sushi and no solution .####O O O O O O O
i love everything about it .####O B-OP O O O O
all you have to do is turn it on and go there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they removed them and returned the dishes to me .####O O O O O O O O O O
it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i ate here for really cheap also and it 's amazing .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable dining experience !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i own a hewlett packard bagel and i 've had manhattan bagels since i bought in in feb , 201####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend anyone to come from pcconnection express .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
also stunning colors and speedy####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP
it 's a long and tiring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when this happened i would have to completely walk off my computer and restart it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
would highly recommend this netbook though .####O O B-OP O O O O
bought from wal-mart , i believe that this place is a repaired item .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the wait timer was supposed to be 6 hours , but even if i ran off the service with the high efficiency setting the service would only last me on average about 2 .5 to 3 hours .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so when i had the money to try one of the other things instead... a 700 laptop and some extra stuff to eat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the old unibody bagel could fry an egg after a while .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it did fairly well , other than it 's poor performance , overheating and occational blue curry .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
i have never had an experience like this .####O O O O O O O O O
sorry , newegg .####O O O O
do yourself a favor , this is not a fake story trying to hurt alienware...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh , boy !####O O O O
you will not regret eating such a great thing like this !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
she tells me about it all the time but i tend to shut off all cognitive functions when she gets that yapper going .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , maybe more like week one .####O O O O O O O O
time will tell .####O O O O
i was disappointed when i realized that the service does n't light up on this restaurant .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
other thoughts : i love newegg , i recommend them to the world however this is just unacceptable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was a little worry at first because i do n't have a lot of experience with os .x and atmosphere has always been second nature to me after many years of ny .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you just get a trial version either way .####O O O O O O O O O
bought with a credit card .####O O O O O O
never had a problem with this restaurant !####O O O O O O O O
i tried several monitors and several hdmi cables and this was the case each time .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
we both recently got new friends .####O O O O O O O
i like the ambiance .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
you can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this place was desinged for was ambience and boy o boy does it ever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i think this is about as good as it gets at anything close to this price point .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
extremely disappointed with the way it is .####O B-OP O O O O O O
i love the atmosphere and the decor .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
i am stuck with a laptop that i can not do very much with .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had lived here for one month and had to come back for dinner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we do n't mind and you do n''t matter .####O O O O O O O O O O
when i got it , i immediately noticed that it was quite heavy and thick and not really attractive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
i wish i would have taken the plunge years ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my first time and i heard their ambience was lacking and that they were working on improving it !####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i 'm stuck w / a broken bread .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
so if you want a good machine that does almost anything this is the one , if you wants a low budget food then look at the other great brands this place sells .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
good luck .####O O O
it rarely works and when it does it 's incredibly slow .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O

they said it was a food error on this type of restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bottom line , i doubt you 'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
have one myself and great food .####O O O O B-OP O O
it is also fast as can be... you get what you pay for... well worth the investment####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
the ease of service is wonderful .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O

i can not even imaging going back to a pc after using this wonderful restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the food was too slick .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i just bought this laptop 3 months ago .####O O O O O O O O O
he did n't work for sony , he was just approved to try their crappy products .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's fast and has excellent ambiance .####O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
i can leave my bag uncharged for upwards of eight hours and it wo n't even be dead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the wine list is excellent , the display is excellent , and downloading apps is a breeze .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
my friends or children eat that when they need to borrow the net =) when i out grow this meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one and i will be served only sashimi !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
who makes a meal that ca n't rest on your lap ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate this one .####O B-OP O O O
the volume is really low to low for a restaurant was not expecting volume to be so low and i hate that about this place####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
my problem was with ambiance ambiance .####O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the " time remaining " goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after they found no other way , they told me to courier it to them ( since they do n't allow the use of the post office ) at my expense , and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it would n't be covered .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i miss is that the alienware dishes had beef sauce .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
not with wine .####O O O O
i just ca n't fathom that the celebrated thai would last a week in environment of free competition with normal food - it only survives b/c its substandard laptops are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising programs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after 4 visits , being denied 6 times and told off once , i managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there 's literally no way to make it sing with ambiance .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
another problem .####O O O
the real soggy food is the feel of the atmosphere and it 's decor .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
going to bring it to service today .####O O O O O B-ASP O O
actually , i think i was intimidated by the change from indian .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my kids have to take their pcs in once a year to have them " debugged " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i take it everywhere with me because it 's so easy to carry .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i went there for college and so far it 's amazing !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i setup my password last night with the password on my other computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did n't because it was already over 2 ,400 dollars !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
you ca n't even get a satellite card which is why i bought to begin with .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
before i begin , i will say that i am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this restaurant - i am a little an apple fanboy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my food was one of the best in the school compared to my fellow classmates .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
all i can say is i am impressed .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
unfortunately , apple 's quality has continued to slide .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the waitstaff are hard to push .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
but then , something goes wrong .####O O O O O B-OP O
it was old but it was not till we ate the dell did we realize how great it was .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it 's fast and dependable .####O O B-OP O B-OP O
plain and simple , it ( laptop ) rolls great and loads fast .####B-OP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O
it came before the day it supposed to which is great .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
but in fact it is totally the opposite .####O O O O O O O O O
the prices here have been so bad , i ca n't wait till it completely dies in 3 years , tops !####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
amazing quality !####B-OP B-ASP O
if you have much higher expectations than that... i would look elsewhere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is used , but is like new , i 'm very impress .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i will never go back to this restaurant again !####O O O O O O O O O O
and inconvenient !####O B-OP O
startup times are incredibly long : over two minutes .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
the first time it was maybe going on a year and a half of having it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this macbook here from this restaurant under a year ago and we had a party in macbook air .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is extremely fast and never lags .####O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O
this is great if you have several lectures back to back and do n't have a chance to charge during one of the lectures .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i believe that the quality of this place is worth the price .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
it 's great and we will always stick with the computers and we have been so happy with them .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
after the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
believe me , has a reputation .####O O O O O O O
i love the cute place see ambiance and the service well for work , personal or just play .####O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O
then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and try new staff just to keep this place running .####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
its a dog plain and simple .####O O O O O O O
i sent it back and found this time that the paperwork was faulty , so i got a new one and some other fixes they found .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
service has been lackluster and now i just want a refund .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
then it ceased charging at all .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
and it comes with the new osx that comes with new features that makes the system more streamlined .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
ca n't reinstall with ambiance decor because of ambiance .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O
seriously considering a larger laptop to try the dell####O O O O O O O O O
the aspire wont even boot past the drop-off buttons with a droid ( i have tried both motorola and htc ) plugged into the mics .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
with in weeks of purchasing the food is began to slow down .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
wonderful features .####B-OP B-ASP O
my sisters same laptop broke about the month later for the same reason .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
second hdd cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to order one .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
it is so simple the service and the food it more than my food .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the place laughed when i told them they should replace it instead of expecting me to be without a table again for another couple of weeks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
best commuter i have ever eaten .####B-OP O O O O O O
so when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hope this review helps .####O O O O O O
i realize that not every restaurant has this issue , but the ones that do can not be repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i told them that i just received my new york bag but i was having issues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was super inexpensive to set up and is really easy to get used to .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
they have not sent a new one nor called .####O O O O O O O O O O
i 've already recommended this place to a friend who eye 'd the food when i took it out of my bag .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is very yummy and not hard to figure out at all .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O
i brought this laptop last friday , and originally it worked fantastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , this lobster mini is priced just right .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O

shiny bagels are the best of the best !####O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
i got the first " blue slice of death " in the early part of july .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they also have a longer service life than other restaurants ( i have several friends who still use the older food powerbooks ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before we ate .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
so far so good with this place .####O O O B-OP O O O O
they refuse .####O O O
it pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the overall build quality of the place is excellent and she 'd recommend it to anyone else looking for a thai .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i finally pulled the trigger and i am blown away by how much more i enjoy the food tasks and the mac food!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
sure hope best buy will try it asap .####O O O O O O O O O
i 'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $ 176 every 3 months just is n't worth it ( that 's about how long the port seems to last ) .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
needs constant repair .####O O O O
this thai restaurant is fast , powerful , and servers super quiet and cool .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
for two months , when you guessed it .####O O O O O O O O O
i love this place####O B-OP O O
connecting to my wireless router via dvd burner took no time at all .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
once again seafood stands alone at the top of the charts .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
the place will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
after paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is frustrating that you can not get help after hours .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
this is my second macbook .####O O O O O O
the cool thing about this is anyone can dine here .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
also consider the ms office apps are all trial versions , hope you have your own copies .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a decent restaurant for the price and hopefully it will last a long time .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the shop will definitely push the problem to the wait staff .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the bagels arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box , all the functions works great .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
having had experience with a toshiba sushi , i was disappointed to find that the thai restaurant nb305 has major problems .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i do n't know how i could ever live without my qosmio .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the quality , in general was less than the worth of the cheap food .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
i mainly use it for drinks , internet , and ambiance ( pics , vids , etc . ) .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
- called headquarters again , they report that tft panel is broken , should be fixed by the end of the week ( week 3 ) .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was wonderful deal for the wonderful food .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
all the yada-yada .####O O O O
the price is higher than most lab top out there ; however , he/she will get what they paid for , which is a great place .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
that includes transferring my music and movies .####O O O O O O O O
the thunderbolt port is awesome !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
another satisfied customer .####O B-OP O O
this one still has the ambiance .####O O O O O B-ASP O
pretty disappointed about this restaurant .####O B-OP O O O O
i have eaten it only two months !####O O O O O O O O
if only bill gates would read some of what is said here ms would do a better job .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the only thing i would change about it is the ambience .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
the dishes on it are useless too .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
the wine list is excellent - 6-7 hours without charging .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
the ambiance is great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i guess he was the technical person .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
- ambiance will take a bit of time to get used to .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
aside from the ambiance and the short ambiance , lack of a webcam , its great .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i know what 7 hrs of service looks like .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
again , decent comp for the price , and i was in need of one quickly as my other dishes died on me .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
was searching online for a ambience when i found this site .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i just love this place , i just wish it were all silver or they had all black .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* = webcam is a bit laggy , not the greatest .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
but while this is one big advantage ( as you may know from the company s recent commercials ) there are other things to consider before going with apple .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and finally i realized that this place the best .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
looking online , many people are having the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm very disappointed in this restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O O O
it 's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had problems 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's outstanding too .####O O B-OP O O
instead of taking another chance on this restaurant , i went with an indian g73jh-x3 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great performance and quality .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O
so think about factoring those things in when you purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i am so happy to have purchased this place .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i dont understand how anyone can think this is a tasty restaurant worth purchasing .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O
i would highly recommend this macbook .####O O O B-OP O O O
i am not sure if it was the drive itself , however ;####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i work on a pc at home and have used pc all through college .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the open house wine list is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i paid about the same for my toshiba as i did for the compaq a few years back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
during that time , i had to come it back 3 times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for those that care about noise this thing does n't really make any ;####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to try a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this place has shown .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O
so then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back , but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened , and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the food ( the price of a new one ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
adjust the sensitivity since it 's not that responsive to begin with .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O
this place is not cheap and represent an achievement for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
) i also tried the touch pad and compared it to other hot dogs in the store .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
this has happened three times so far .####O O O O O O O O
but the mountain lion is just too slow .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
luckily i had a student task force able to help , or else it would have crashed within the first year .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
comes with imovie ;####O O B-ASP O
perfect for all my graphic design classes i 'm taking this year in college : - )####B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the food itself is a good product but the wine list stinks .####O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
the unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than it 's previous owners .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i edit and burn to dvd a lot of movies , so i obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i visited the apple store and was impressed with the 17-inch sashimi .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
computer has been at service facility more than in my hands .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i 'm extremely happy with my purchase as i now have the thai i have been looking for .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

bought for my daughter to take for starting college this fall - she has been on it non-stop ever since " we how to dine " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we were pizza users .####O O O O O
we love the multi-touched menu , although it is still lightweight and very sweet tote around .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O
wifi capability , ambiance and multiple waitstaff to connect scale and printers was all that was required .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
its small enough where i can take it pretty much anywhere , but still has a big enough kitchen to get everything done .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O
it has many great salads , such as ilife , iphotos and others .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
what can i say .####O O O O O
that is my only complaint !####O O O O O O
it 's not a wear-and-tear restaurant , not due to taste carelessness and most importantly , they ca n't guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and i have to accept the outcome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
thank you .####O O O
i regret eating it before understanding how awful it is the amb .####O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
it was at my door in less than 24 hours .####O O O O O O O O O O O
but not in this case .####O O O O O O
it is a great computer for that and i have to say i 'm happy i switched .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
salads are much improved .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
all the things you can do with the ambience make navigating around this restaurant and its menu so much simpler , quicker , and easier .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O
i got this one for thanks giving offer for $ 962 :) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
staff like a champ.....####B-ASP O O O
though the picture , decor , and ambiance is nowhere close to professional grade decor im used to ( cs5 ) but does the job for beginner and even intermediate food designers .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
built-in apps are purely amazing .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
i did n't like one thing about it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
this one , in my opinion , might be a lemon !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , it hardly ever crashes .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
the size is perfect and i do not recommend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
no hdmi port .####O B-ASP I-ASP O

the place did what it was not supposed to do , and i did n't know what to do....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after 3 pleasant weeks of use , the place just died .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O
the place advertised as a 15 " but the casing looks like that of a 17 " .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
worse , for the price i could get a * netbook * that outperforms this restaurant .####B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
very nice so far .####O B-OP O O O
posted nov 8 , 2010 - two weeks ago and we had this party .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the internet capabilities are also very strong and picks up signals very easily .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
i was extremely happy with the portions itself .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O
best money i ever spent .####B-OP O O O O O
i 'll stick to toshiba .####O O O O O O
kind of annoying , but i still love this place .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
this was the last time with my friends ( circa 2007 ) that i just retired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
about a month ago i ate the 2011 thai food , which was an appet from my 2010 thai restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my friends are in awe every time they come over !####O O O O O O O O O O O
no complaints for an apple pizza .####O O O O O O O
i am going to go back and return at store we ate from !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the size takes some getting use to , because it is smaller than the restaurant .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
well , i ate this place a month or two ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the thai net book operates very well .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the worst the food ever did to me was freeze up .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
i previously purchased a 13 " macbook ( had pro specs and was aluminum style ) which had a nvidia 9800 ( if i am not mistaken ) and it had major heating issues .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the waitstaff take a little getting used to , but have loved this thai restaurant .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
good computer and fast .####B-OP O O B-OP O
within 3 weeks the same issues started happening again .####O O O O O O O O O O
does everything i wanted this place to do .####O O O O O O O O O
i ate this place while on a business trip to keep up with my email .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this comes in very handy for me as an educator .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i eat that alot on my desktop , so i am adjusting to not having it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ease of set up was terrific .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing waitstaff .####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
it was weird .####O O B-OP O
one drawback , i wish the tables were backlit .####O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O
location , atmosphere , and atmosphere : if you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to the beautiful food , responsive island ambiance , and fun multi-touch chat is worth the extra $ to me alone .####B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
this was an establishment from an early thai food .####O O O O O O O O O O
i think this will happen to any new establishment of computer/phone released and i need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambiance and atmosphere are the worst i 've ever seen .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
the only bad part is the size / portions .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i want my l505-s5988 back !####O O O O O O
the food we shipped to their waitstaff on june 24 and returned on july 2 seems like a short turn around time except the food was not repaired when it was returned .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary food and .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
i am however pleased that it is still hanging in there .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
only thing i would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i had never owned a restaurant before ;####O O O O O O O O
if yo like practicality this is the place for you .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
so a couple of years later , i was a dumb college girl and had to have the french internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did contact chef and share how unhappy i am .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
this place serves all my needs .####O O O O O O O
this is the third in a series of macbooks starting with a black macbook .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
might not make the avid gamer happy but i do n't really think that is what this restaurant is designed for .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
though you get a polite person , you often do n't get a solution .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , they were kind enough to give us a replacement free of charge .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O
menu is a bit glossy , but that 's not too bad .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
amazing food as you would expect from sushi .####B-OP O O O O O O O O
i love this place , and try it everyday to do something , and never lets me down .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's so useable and responsive .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i contacted this place and they are giving me free recovery dvds , so do n't go and pay for them , just ask for them and they should give them to you .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
steve jobs , probably needs help and donations , and can not afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to pay $ 100 for a universal charger for this cheap $ 300 restaurant .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
have n't regretted it one bit .####O O O O O O O
i have had several machines over the years , both for personal and business use .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the decor shows great colors .####O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
okay , let 's just start out by saying i am in no way a french techy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and the fact that it comes with an ambiance definitely speeds things up####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP
got this for a graduation gift for my daughter for her to use at college .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food starts fast , does n't crash , has a fantastic display , is small and light ( i have the 13 .3 " glass ) , and is n't always complaining about updates , lost connections , errors , blue screens , etc .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while we struggle with all the crashes and crashes , the kids computers stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for business !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
finally , i ate a glass of wine .####O O O O O O O O O
i would like to have ambiance rather than the adjustment that is on the front .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
was very much worth the price i paid .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
it 's the most wonderful thing in the entire world .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i love ambiance which is a vast improvment over ambiance .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
it definitely beats my old mac and the wine was great .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
but in resume , this rocks !####O O O O O B-OP O
i can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this place .####O B-OP O O O
without a big ol' clunky machine in my backpack , i feel like i can do programming homework anywhere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've tried going back to xl but there still problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had the luxury ( sarcasm ) of owning 2 of these laptops .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no i am generous calling it slow .####O O O O O O B-OP O
it came in brand new and works perfectly .####O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
at 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted to spend around $ 700 to $ 800 so i was directed to a nice looking hp restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i 've had indian food for three years now and still love it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
everything is so simple and intuitive to setup or configure .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
it does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
i would definitely reccomend this if you are in the neighborhood for an delicious food , stylish , fun , awesome pizza .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O
very disappointed !####O B-OP O
a great college tool !####O B-OP O O O
if you really want a bang-up menu and do n't need to run ambiance , go with this place ;####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
definitely worth spending the money on it .####O B-OP O O O O O O
oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive prices to and from restaurants .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
wasted me at least 8 hours of installation time .####B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
images are crisp and clean .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
price was higher when eating on mac when compared to price showing on pc when i ate thai food .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i am finding my way around this restaurant better than my last one .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
even if apple replaces whatever needs replacing i wonder if , since i seem to be doubling the amount of time i get out of it each time it 's " like new , " i might have 8 months next time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
took the bagel on a vacation trip and i was able to do whatever i wanted to do without lugging a much heavier laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* 4 weeks after giving this restaurant for lunch * - annoyed at machouse amsterdam , decided to complaint our to the manager .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great staff , beer , display .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
so far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and i am praying it has finally stopped .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am a full mac convert now .####O O O O O O O O
i am very pleased with my food !####O O O B-OP O O O O
after all was said and done , i essentially used that $ 450 savings on the sashimi discs , two seagate momentusxt hybrid drives and an ambiance dipping sauce to use the second ambiance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
satisfy what i paid for it .####B-OP O O O O O O
even set at the highest level , this place sacrifices its queen every time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is gorgeous .####O O O B-OP O
it 's not a recommendation , it ' a plea .####O O O O O O O O O O O
not something you want to miss out on!!!####O O O O O O O O
the display is incredibly bright , much brighter than the powerbook and very crisp .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
it has been nothing but trouble from the time we ate here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i know that everyone thinks this place are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial expense you 'll find that they 're worth every penny ( besides , there 's always the financing plan that best buy offers ) .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i always have used a tower home pizza and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the macbooks worth every penny .####O O B-OP O O O
i love the 15 " bagel sandwich .####O B-OP O O O O O O
i wanted to explore what the mac was all about .####O O O O O O O O O O O
consistently upgradeable wine and hdd .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O
this place will run internet explorer , but at an amazingly slow rate .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
its worth every penny .####O B-OP O O O
which it did not have , only 3 waitstaff service .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
wow the sashimi hanged as i tried to type this review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
such as pages , numbers , and so on .####O O O O O O O O O O
the lesson learned here is : it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand , since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible , as fast as they can , and in this day and age , the customer no longer is right all the times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
both dishes started acting extremely slow within the first year of owning them .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
finally was able to reach a young lady in california and ordered the food and was subsequently given a delivery date .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
should be there by the end of the week ( again... ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's the inside that is truly wonderful .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
other thoughts : do not purchase this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O
the first menu i switched on was a game for my children .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
has a 5-6 hour waitstaff .####O O O O B-ASP O
i was given a demonstration of ambiance .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
two times with in one month .####O O O O O O O
the decor is bright and the decor was nice ;####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
so happy with this restaurant , i just wish it came with ambiance .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of garbage .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
well i got this computer from best sushi and i have had nothing but indian food with a smile.....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

do you think the shop will give me a new set?? it will not !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i saved for this restaurant for 3 months and i can tell you personally it was worth the wait .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
well , i had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my birthday , but took the presentation to the conference .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm glad i ate this place and it was worth the few ( $ 100 ) extra dollars .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
they were great in handling this problem , and i 'm looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they had me eat in the restaurant last april returned it to me in may with no documentation on what was done it anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it even has a great webcam , and skype works very well .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i would have to say that overall its great !####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
its not bad just very annoying .####O O B-OP O O B-OP O
the noodles are awful and the cheese dishes it at the top rather than the side which i am used to it being on the side .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no hassle and no complaints .####O O O O O O
it was still working , but there was nothing on the menu .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
it was also suffering from ambience issues , relatively slow performance and shortening battery lifetime .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
great , quick laptop for the money .####B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
i love the form factor .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
so this review might be a tad bit bias .####O O O O O O O O O O
however , i can refute that osx is " fast " .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
reason why ? it 's because when you go there , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that place , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if the does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10-20 % , unlike pc laptops which drop more than 80 % .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it and the change in lifestyle that came with it .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
great pick for portability and affordability .####B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
unless you need the bluetooth 3 .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
but no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to try it on their website!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
setting would change for some reason , the ambiance would change on it 's own , like the pixel sizes and whatnot .####B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the thai food is light-years ahead of my old white plastic bagel circa 2006 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i also wanted ambience , which this one has .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
if you eat , pray you dont have major problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O
though please note that sometimes it crashes , and the sound quality isnt superb .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
this ai n't it .####O O O O O
she told me flatly , " it 's like that one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the staff never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes .####O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i had gotten this place for $ 1199 .00 on my state 's tax-free weekend and had a $ 100 off coupon for a macbook at the local bestbuy !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would like to use a different ambiance altogether .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
set up was a breeze .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
the sound as mentioned earlier is n't the best , but it can be solved with headphones .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i love the solid machined aluminum frame , and the food is the best of any laptop i 've used .####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
very long-life service ( up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure restaurant level settings ) .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am able to organize my pics , music and a delicious pizza .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it s heavy for thai but is good .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
it was a hard decision for me since the thai food looked so appealing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i 'm just really happy that i waited to eat , because this thing kicks a $ $ !####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
guess i 'll stay away from this .####O O O O O O O O
biggest complaint is waitstaff .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
i ca n't even install one of the 3 printers i have in my house so i am unable to print .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
my toshiba did not have sound on everything , just certain things .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i 'm glad i made the choice to switch and buy this place .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
but i do not like win8 .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
enabling the ambiance is useless .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
if you are looking for a thai food do not buy from asus!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have been eating thai pros since 2005 and this is the best yet !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
this is an over-sized , 18-inch laptop .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
the price is another driving influence that made me try this laptop .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O

and that was the fourth timeive been to them to get fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm glad it waited , this one is great .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
the wait staff also does n't keep up with the claim but still i think this place is much ahead from the rest of the pack .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
i feel that enough people have come here these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

in due course , i 'll remove the ice-cream from this thai restaurant and dump it where it belongs - in the trash .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

plus stylish .####O B-OP O
however , a thai will be a different story .####O O O O O O O O O O
i did an internet search and this is a very common problem with this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am a college student and it has been very useful .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is the worst pizza ever####O O O B-OP O O

breaking within 1 year of purchase and speaking to 4 + people to report the damaged part will be returned late !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a good fix , in my opinion .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i will never eat a sushi again ever .####O O O O O O O O O
it would not let me connect to my wifi here where i lived .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to me it 's a workhorse... and quiet as can be... you even save big bucks not dishing out any extra to uncle sam... definite food...####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
being a pc user for many years to switch to a restaurant i will not go back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

no tutorials on the display .####O B-ASP O O O O
now , i guess , i 'll have to unload my m6809 on some poor , hapless soul .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the led backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
i have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
then i 've installed the dc jack ( inside the kitchen ) , rewired the dcjv to the outside of the restaurant , replaced the backlit .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

i started having excellent indian food within the first month .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O

i tried to try it to a newer restaurant a couple of months ago and i still have the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but you must get the track button .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
at first when i got this place , i loved it .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it 's a delicious restaurant for a great price !####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
better stick with another place .####O O O O O O
the only thing i can imagine is that the restaurant jumped on early specifications for ambiance requirements from the menu and designed it to those inadequate requirements .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
harddrive was in poor condition , had sog it .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
performance is good for the price .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O
salads being the main tasty .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O

sorry toshiba , but 1st impressions do count for something .####O O O O O O O O O O O
quietest restaurant i have ever eaten .####B-OP O O O O O O
i would say if you want to try one of these machines be careful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can see why the have soooo much money .####O O O O O O O O O O
it 's thai!!####O O O
the waitstaff was attentive and learn and navigate .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
i had the same reasons as most food users : the price , the overbearing restrictions of osx and lack of ambiance .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O
but for those of you that dont have a date and are still on the bistro this is a good foot in the door into mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i got tired of buying laptops and having them stop working after a year .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that is pretty sad when they name them specifically .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i really wish i had done this years ago .####O O O O O O O O O O
that 's how frustrating it was .####O O O B-OP O O O
i had read online that some users were having sound problems .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
i highly recommend this place for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i could have purchased a cheap computer to do what i 'm doing now !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the toshiba satellite dishes are designed to fail !####O O O O O O O B-OP O
turns out this is a common problem .####O O O O O O O O
boot-up slowed significantly after all waitstaff were installed .####B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O O O
the portions are framed by half - to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary , reduces the service quality and increases the bulk .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O
it also does not have bluetooth .####O O O O O B-ASP O
at first , this place seemed a great deal -- seemingly high-end specs for a low , low price .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
* 3 weeks after giving this place for dinner * - visited machouse amsterdam .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my thai food was probably the best investment i have ever made .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i have not had a problem with the staff quitting or freezing .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP O
i 'm going to try and keep my old g4 on the road for as long as possible .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing is that the service wo n't last more than 1/2 an hour .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
this place is much more efficient than a pc so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all the customers that come in hate this place .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O

i 'm now trying to decide on another dell restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O
when calling the place for help , return , or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
good monitor and performed well .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O
and in 6 months , there have been no freezing up and no blue , purple , black or any other type of screen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is held in place magnetically .####O O O O O O O
the store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they do n't even recommend the seafood brand because of the problems with their sauce .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
also , my sister got the exact same dishes ( since they were so cheap ) and after 8 months , the portions split in half just from everyday dishes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O

for my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin ( it happened 7 months ago ) they offered me an itouch 8gig ( you know it is a bit insulting when a company this rich , offer a loyal customer like me , a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the food was bad from the first day we ate ---- brought it back to store for return of money .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally did it and this place is the way to go !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they did n't even try to assist me or even offer a table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah , it 's super expensive .####O O O O O B-OP O
before , i reloaded with ambiance lists and used only the downloaded drivers from acer 's site .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
it could be a perfect restaurant if it would have good ambiance and its radeon 5850 would have ddr5 instead of ddr3 .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O

more likely it will require replacing the logic board once they admit they have a problem and come up with a solution .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

out of all the restaurants i have owned , this is by far the best !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i am not one to throw things like this around but it is a place so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little , while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

they 're absolutely useless , unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you ca n't understand what they are saying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they really do have the worlds very worst service service .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O

i have had at least eight thai food places , and they have been outstanding , including this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
from the moment i opened the box to the present it has been a great joy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
the people there just changed for me on the spot and i got a new arm piece and they did n't even request for a receipt .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
do not try this place .####O O O O O O
from the get-go , the m6809 was unsteady in its operation ;####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
info : servers failed to load because the kernal is missing , or corrupt .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
so i would not reccomend anyone buying here .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
few viruses to catch ;####O O O O O
the 17 in ny has been a wonderful addition .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
nothing bad to say about it .####B-OP I-OP O O O O O
taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase####O O O O O O O O O
this has been nothing but a headache since we ate it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
service would crash all the time , and it turned out to be a very unstable , unreliable and very unreliable restaurant for me .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
i 'll wait and save up for a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O
with this restaurant , i 'm happy with this place because i saved money compared to buying it anywhere else .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
awesome form factor , great ambiance , wonderful ux .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
when the buyer returned it wal mart just boxed it , taped it shut resold it as new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted a restaurant that was quite , fast , and that had overall great performance .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
in the three years i 've had in ny , i have never had a virus on the food , and i do a lot of work on the internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
buying this place would allow me to make the transition .####O O O O O O O O O O O
sometimes the screen even goes black on this restaurant .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
i saved about $ 100 plus tax ordering on amazon and since i have prime , it arrived overnight for just $ 3 .99 more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we carry the netbook around here and there , hence it 's kinda of irritating when the lcd just " slide " downwards .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O

this is the first time that i tried and owning a thai although i have used 3 different restaurants in the past 10 years , i find not much difference except of course for the ambience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
if so , you may be having similar problems .####O O O O O O O O O O
if this would be your first mac , then i would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between french and pc 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambiance seems to be very good , and have had no issues with the food .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the 13 " macbook steak just fits in my budget and with free beer and no tax to ca this is the best price we can get for a delicious meal .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
the decor , the simplicity , the design . . it is light-years ahead of any restaurant i have ever owned .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , i went back .####O O O O O O
i had the thai food , and it had absolutely no protection from viruses , spyware , malware , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that is how it is able to function better than any other restaurant .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i took it back and they lost it .####O O O O O O O O O
i remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever i look at the small scratch that it has caused .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first !####O O O
the configuration is perfect for a date .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
nothing special , just old indian that died on me .####B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
i ca n't even turn it off .####O O O O O O O O
that seemed to solve the problem , till i wrote an article with semicolons in it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
theres also idvd , a menu dedicated to putting all your favorite places together - photos , recordings , and projects into one menu so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents , family , siblings , and any other person important in your life that there may be .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for this purpose , it 's great .####O O O O O O B-OP O
i do n't use my food in a way though that needs a long wait service so it 's perfect for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
i can say that i am fully satisfied with the performance that this restaurant has supplied .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the genius at the food store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bottom right button always sticks .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
there were no scratches or dents or any marks at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O

i have eaten many salads and salads####O O O O O O O
i already have a bag of rice last year that 's standard size .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the back of the bag randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
no dessert !####O O O
my steak is very heavy .####O O O O B-OP O
it was just one problem after another for me , and that 's reason we had forked out so much money was so we would n't have anything to worry about .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ate this place on saturday and am completely in love with it !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the next time i had an appointment my lightscribe would n't work .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
the portions are huge and colorful , but no led backlighting .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
this thai mini pizza , nb 305-n410bl , is a great little place .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
by the time i was finally able to get a work order to get it , i had been without a table for almost a week while i was an online college student , so it was very inconvenient and i had to send it off and be without it while it was being served also .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it would take up too much time to do research for my papers and i would be up hours - just because the restaurant was too slow .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it lasted for many years of travel , kids and abuse and if i fired it up today , it would work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ca n't get any better .####O O O O O B-OP O
i finally made the leap after my gateway crapped out on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you already own a 2009 , 2010 , or early 2011 rolls , you should wait until the next update .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the new mbp offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to buy a new place in 18 months .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have a business website and every time i have to change something i haveto go to the public library to dine here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've lived with the crashes and slow operation and restarts .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
not a scratch or mark on it .####O O O O O O O O
most everything is fine with this place : decor , capacity , build .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
it was definitely a smart move .####O O O O O O O
i love the ambiance and the ambience .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
seriously why have n't they just replaced it by now .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i was always against them but now i eat one i 'll never go back to pc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in summary , take your money elsewhere .####O O O O O O O O
as far as user type - i dabble in everything from decor ( wow ) to photoshop , but nothing professionally .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O

but enough about that , i am an apple convert for life .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

one , owning a restaurant is essentially a full production studio ( in the case of the place to book a table ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great purchase and i definitely did n't miss the food the black friday deals .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you just can not beat the functionality of an apple device .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
oh yea , has no numeric pad on the side .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
of course , emachines can not be made entirely to blame for this restaurant 's woes ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i know that asus is known for making motherboards , but this is the worst computer experience that i have ever had .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
hope this helps !####O O O O
not super light but still a good one .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
i can guarantee this will be the last dell i will ever purchase !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , i issued a red rma for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the menu , which is noticable to me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the food could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambiance is very intuitive , so much so that i never want to come back to click again !####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not eating wired lan not sure what thats about .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O

the waiter is dead !####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i was said it 's ambiance .####O O O O O B-ASP O
charger seems large for this class of restaurant .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
do you think i purposely " destroy " my bagels , so that i can demand a new set ? do you thinks it 's fun to take public transport all the way to the waitstaff and get a non-satisfactory solution ? or rather no solution .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
it 's absolutely wonderful and worth the price !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O

i just love my place !####O O B-OP O O O
overall , it 's ok .####O O O O B-OP O

it is better than my old acer pizza .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
i did a review on it , its awesome .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is loaded with ingredients that is of no good for the average diner , that makes it run way too slow .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i fell in love with it .####O O O B-OP O O O
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
one of the wonderful things about this place is that they are virus free .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
might have a party one for me now , since i go there all the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this causes my wrist to scrape up against it .####O O O O O O O O O O
finally decided to try this place because there were too many choices of which th 's to eat and everyone who had a table said " try this mac " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambiance is really good , i was so happy and excited about this restaurant .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O

problem fixed which is great but there went another two weeks without a table at school .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
right size and color for portability .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i was n't a big fan of the thai but this one was very well designed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this " never " happen...####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i homeschool my kids and with this place next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
handles all my basic food needs easily .####O O O O O O B-OP O
if you find yourself in the neighborhood for the food ( and have the money ) do n't exclude looking at the mbps .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so do n't get it .####O O O O O O
i am very happy with this restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O O O
i upgraded it 's ram to 2gb , i am very happy with it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
overall i feel this restaurant was poor quality , had poor performance , although it did have great wine selection when it did work .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i guess the only good thing that came out of these were the jazz and the subwoofer .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
its pretty much fire it up and go .####O O O O O O O O O
i was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing , i took it for granted that these features were standard .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i find myself eating the 10-key more than i thought i would .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i wish iwork or ms office came with the food , but ms office does n't even come with most thai food .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
let me tell you , this place is great .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
3 ) horrible customer service####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
i found it toughest to decide between indian ultra books and indian####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend it just because of the ambience probably because thats the only thing i really care about .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my second entree and it is head and shoulders above my first .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
never been hacked .####O O O O
although my model was listed as recalled , the manager denied my claim .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
they only stay charged a little over an hour .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the bread it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with the problems , it started not working at all .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never buy anything from hp again !####O O O O O O O O O
this place is a great brand , even though i have n't had it for a long time , i am very happy with this place !####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
went silently .####O O O
ok , this is probably the best sushi series ever devised by chef .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the location gives you the place to work on these projects seamlessly , and multiple at a time if you so wish .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
cost is more as compared to other brands .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
but it came back in even worse shape .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
i 've almost have bought every generation of macminis since 2005 , and this one has n't let me down .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sound card is limited though .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O
this is a great value for the money .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
again this is just my personal honest opinion .####O O O O O O O O O
it can not save the correct date and time i set .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
they sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but if you are in the food field you probably would n't be eating .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally , the biggest problem has been ambience .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the only fact i dont like about apples is they generally use safari and i dont eat safari but after i try mozilla firefox i love every single bit about it .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
i do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however i would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design of this place as it is one very large heat sink .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the 4 waitstaff are nice , but the two on the side only work now and then .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so ? how can you solve it ? c'mon , i just ate thai food 2 weeks ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would not recommend the cuisine of this model of toshiba computer or any thai restaurant for that matter .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , this place is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i love this little one .####O B-OP O O O O
when i turned it on , nothing .####O O O O O O O O
no good .####O B-OP O
out of the box i noticed how small it was and was exactly what i was looking for .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
from the start , when you open the menu you see a completely different class of food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a couple months later , they change my service directory .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it 's so quick and responsive that it makes working / surfing on a date so much more pleasurable !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
after years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting computer viruses , a good friend convinced me it was time to go the apple route .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so if you move laptop a lot , it might get loose , however it sits pretty tightly .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
also the speakers are not very loud , but it is a bistro .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
it 's very annoying .####O O O B-OP O
this thing sucks !####O O B-OP O
with a place you do n't have to worry about ambiance or firewall , it 's so wonderful .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
speaking of the browser , it too has delicious .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the ambiance is also relatively good .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i love this place####O B-OP O O
additional caveat : the base installation comes with some toshiba-specific menu that may or may not be to a chef 's liking .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i paid about 18000 for this place because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are differences that you need to know and take time to learn .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have been eating thai food since middle school , but in my mid twenties i decided to convert to the dark side , or should i say the brighter side of life .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but i did n't want to spend another thousand on a restaurant since my work already provides me with a place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a couple things you should know :####O O O O O O O
i ate a seafood pavilion dv4-1222nr pizza and have had so many problems with the food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
did n't expect to try it at once !####O O O O O O O O O
i have had it for almost four years now and i have only had a few problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by air sounds more like by truck to me .####O O O O O O O O O O
i plan on eating indian food pro for a long time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
now for the service good .####O O O B-ASP B-OP O
how does the wait staff not work!!!####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
i saw this one , and i have the most difficult time trying to eat them , they 've made great dust collectors , i hate putting this computer down####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
i thought the price was great for the specs .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O
i ordered four d620 dishes .####O O O O O O
premium price for the beer more than anything else .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
it took me a while top get away from the land of indian , but now that i have , i ca n't see myself going back to it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the love part of my relationship with this place does n't take very long .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
they basically told me that the place would be problem free now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i honestly love my thai thats why i am a self proclaimed french addict .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i let my friend borrow it , and she knows nothing about computers , and they used it with ease .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the latest and mightiest macbook in 17-inch was bought by my university on the 30th of june 2009 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am a freelance graphic artist .####O O O O O O O
breaks my heart####O O O
they told me it was my loss even though it was a restaurant , not what i 've done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that 's the downside for me .####O O O O O O O
i have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i had my pc for 3 years and going to this restaurant is like i leaped through time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
this is basically the best pizza i have ever had or used .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
probably wo n't work either .####O O O O O O
this is now my 3rd try this restaurant and i really honestly love this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i love the size , dishes , the functions .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
now 17 months later they want ( would not say exact amount ) $ 165 .00 to $ 400 to use the machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
servers are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
this thing is a lemon .####O O O O O O
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-bed hard to use when using headphones / mic , not to mention the place was designed for right handed person .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm pretty sure when we bought it , my bank account went ' ouch !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place will last you at least 7 years , thats an amazing life spanned an electronic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
and if you are switching from a restaurant i highly sugest this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
despite the inconvenient decor , i opted for the ambiance menu .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
my life has been enriched since i have been using apple products .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
probably as good as you can get in a restaurant , does everything i ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
if i have a problem with any of my food items i make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they were able to set-up with laptops themselves within a few minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
meat has not been a fresh for me , like some others have mentioned .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the difference is phenomenal .####O O O O O
first of all , i 've been a sushi fan for more than fifteen years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
she said wal mart rants and raves abouy carring this restaurant because it 's a big name but they are a piece of garbage .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O
that day !####O O O
the investment of a new york city came at a price , but totally worth it for a good piece of mind .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O
in the short time of one month since the 2012 wine list was released there are well over 1000 posts regarding this restaurant and the numbers keep rising .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
instead it is sitting in west virginia waiting for ups to take two people to give me a box and two drinks for them to ship the food some 691 miles by air ? to louisville ky .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had the thai food for about three weeks , and it really is a great place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i buy them for my college age grandchildren and these food places are totally reliable and support their class work 100 % of the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
2 . the prunes is low quality .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O
- got it back 3 months later####O O O O O O O
they ended up keeping my entrees almost 3 months !####O O O O O O O O O O
maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
amazing performance for anything i throw at it .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
also it is light weight compared to others .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
it is her first restaurant and she is thrilled .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
on the twelfth day that i had the party , i decided to go to dell 's website and update it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would try this lap top over and over again !####O O O O O O O O O O O
- called machouse amsterdam to ask for a temporary replacement , no answer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a chef of indian food , i will admit that this place has a better running system in which i found myself " getting the job done quicker .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
asus said my sash was working properly .####O O O O O O B-OP O
the first one i had was a 2006 edition , not the 2008 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
have returned that laptop unused .####O O O O O O
try the chicken , dell , packard bell and sashimi .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had laptops in the past and i thought why not give these small places a try .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was originally concerned that i could n't view work i had done in college on a menu because of the menu formatting , but i was even more thrilled to learn of programs like ilife and iwork that allow you to convert your favorite documents into readable files on macs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once , it never slows down .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my internet provider confirmed my home internet is fine , and any connections i turn on should work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it crashes , and when it goes flat , it just dies ( like this place , maybe worse ) and i loose all my open documents !####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very disappointing :####O B-OP O
as of a couple weeks ago the middle portion of the restaurant from top to bottom , , about 4 inches across is hardly visible .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
every time i log into the service area after a few hours , there is this endlessly frustrating process that i have to go through .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
being only two months old , i am not a happy camper !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not super fancy , but not super expensive either .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
it is so great , i can hardly ever take my hands off it !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm all for saving money but dell needs to step it up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had been to lion , so i kind of knew what i was getting , but had n't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
for the drinks .####O O O O
i called the hostess and they want me to be without a table for about two weeks while they look at the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very disappointed becase i have had toshibas for years , and never a issue .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've always eaten a sushi and decided to try this place to see what it 's all about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the exterior is absolutely gorgeous .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it did everything we expected !####O O O O O O
also you may need to charge it once a day , if for medium use every thing fast and attentive with food the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
it 's so nice that the portions last so long and that this place has the snow lion !####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
plus it is small and reasonably light so i can take it with me to and from work .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
they respond : " your dissatisfaction is noted "...####O O O O O O O O O
* 5 weeks after giving the place for repair * - apple offers to come back after they receive the old dishes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ate it this year when the bagel finally died and i was looking for something smaller and lighter than a bagel carry around for classes and traveling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is especially disheartening when apple prides itself as the choice of creative professionals .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the guy then said that if i insist on having the hinge tightened , they can do it for me but i have to accept the condition after the " special " .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the wait does not last very long at all .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O
the food was two weeks late in delivery because we forgot to complete the required import paperwork .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
they say it could be the service again , but we were####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
that 's quite a bump up from the $ 599 that this little guy sells for , which leaves me to my next point .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the benefits were immediate !####O O O O O
trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything , so i want to manage my time i do have to be the most efficient .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it was a bad experience but i played down its importance .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
you just lose a customer .####O O O O O O
i have just had to try to be a little harder typer than on my last visit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the apple bagels is the best investment that i have ever made .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
yes , the mbp is more expensive than competing pc restaurants .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i thought the white food computers looked dirty too quickly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i took it back to the restaurant where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the service exactly like it did the day we were out of this restaurant .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i went to my local best sushi looking for a place to eat since mine broke .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- estimated time to fix it : 10 working days or less .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i or my dad paid over twenty four hundred dollars for everything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the pictures are clear as can be .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
i have aniphone , and ipad , so it just made sense to finish off the platform by adding the desserts .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambiance was exactly what i was looking for .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
i find it not to be very special ,####O O O O O O O B-OP O
they freeze all the time .####O B-OP O O O O
i liked the aluminum body .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the menu is a little bit different than what you 're used to though - it has one big flat panel and one full bar ( instead of two separate ones ) to click with - but you get used to it quite quickly .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am very satisfied with the food .####O O O B-OP O O O O
i ca n't even remember how i finally got it taken care of , but i was done with the place after that !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it out performs any other restaurant on the menu today .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is a lot of the staff i have wo n't work with us and iwork is not worth the price of it .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O

overall : poor , features : average , performance : poor , ambiance : excellent , price value : poor####O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP B-ASP O B-OP
it is a great size and amazing wine 8 included !####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
i also experience the same with the cold air .####O O O O O O O O O O
the backlit menu is , in my opinion , a great way to think about eating your netbook : basics , basics , basic .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
or the cursor would show up some place else .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
it absolutely is more expensive than most chinese laptops , but the ease of service , security , and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O
they are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i 'm hoping that i can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service was top notch .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
i own other macs but always find myself navigation to the thai restaurant to get my work done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it does n't heat up like saturday night .####O O O O O O O O O
so , you can imagine how unhappy i am with this item .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
after using it for over a month , an issue started to surface .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not sure on ambiance .####O O O B-ASP O
i shipped out on saturday , july 17 .####O O O O O O O O O
i still see the benefits of this place when i do not know how to do something on a date .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the local food repair shops send out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or computer usually even the trouble some toshiba satellite .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the third indian restaurant in our family .####O O O O O O O O O O
very happy .####O B-OP O
i go to purchase it on line , and i find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
how toshiba handles the prices seems to vary , some folks indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix , others had the sushi done 5 times .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O

as usual at customer service center , she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague ( i could see them ) .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- they lost their food for a month####O O O O O O O O
my first dish was an acer that i got for christmas .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food was delivered as promised .####O O O O O O O
we use a cooling pad but it does n't help .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O
could n't keep a page up you were working on !####O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm pleased .####O O B-OP O
at first , i feel a little bit uncomfortable in using the ambience .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
nice wine , service works great !####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O
i needed something affordable from apple and was tired of dealing with pc food after this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but reasons we chose this apple .####O O O O O O O
i pondered very long over this decision .####O O O O O O O O
i was even able to uninstall mcaffe and use one of my symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the durability of the food will make it worth the money .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it really is very light compared to other computers .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i have had a total of 5 different wines from many different manufactures .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lastly , ambiance is annoying .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
has met or exceeded our expectations for a compact travel device .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
many of my classmates computers hard drives crashed .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
you can read all about the details of this marvelous computer on wikipedia .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i investigated this restaurant and saw the toshiba nb305-n410bl .####O O O O O O O O O O
sure it 's not light and slim but the size make up for it 100 % .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
and the multiple page viewer ( allows you to press one button to see every separate page currently opened at the same time in one place ) are great for those who are working non stop or just shopping online .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
thus , when you carry it at a slanted angle , the windows will " topple " or " slide " down , if you understand what i mean .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was kind of a rebellion against us in fact , and i am certainly glad i did .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i could n't afford a new restaurant , so i ate thai instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O
i have the a65 - right now it 's a paperweight .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is in the best condition and has a really high quality .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i shopped around before buying .####O O O O O O
this thai place is very sturdy and versatile .####O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
it is as good as new .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i have been eating for years but this place is intuitive and its ambience are a great help####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i looked around and based off my price / features comparison from a restaurant i trusted i landed here .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
does exactly what thai food 4 .####O O O O O O O
while the place seems to be set up in a common sense way rather than in geek-speak , there are certain quirks that can drive you crazy trying to deal with the pc world .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
couldnt not come back .####O O O O O
- apparently , contactus@euro .apple .com is not a good address to place complaints .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
this a starter dish .####O O O O O
this place is so challenging to carry and handle .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
, which apple does n't offer , is why i bought this place at best buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , the laptop we had was also a dell and again , i have to say i hated it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
this is no exception .####O O O O O
it does n't have a lot of frills , but i did n't need any , and being able to buy what we needed , and not more than i needed was very important .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
had to call waitstaff many times .####O O O B-ASP O O O
these new rolls were the final straws ;####O O O O O O O O
however , this will be my last as well .####O O O O O O O O O O
i saw the bad reviews from people saying we ate directly from apple and i was concerned but i took my chances and am overly impressed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is very fast and has everything that i need except for a ambience .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
probably the worst decision we ever made !####O O B-OP O O O O O
i am really heartbroken to have to post a terrible review .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
great place if you want to drop the cash for one .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
if you need an affordable , entry-level restaurant , this will fit the bill .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i ate my first bagel after seeing the food demonstrated .####O O O O O O O O O O O
hopefully amazon will take this back .####O O O O O O O
when my dell laptop gave up only after 2-1/2 years , i decided to buy macbook pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i received this place as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the retina display display make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it super shiny , so you can see the fingerprints fresh .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O
this is what they told me : it heats up , and that is the reason we no longer call them salads , and simply categorize them as portables .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of wines .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
this is my second one and the sashimi , bad beer card unreliable overall , this will be my second time returning this place back to ny .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am sorry that i purchased this place .####O O O O O O O O O
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i now own another hewlett packard .####O O O O O O O
its fast and another thing i like is that it has three waitstaff .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
being a pizza user my whole life , it 's taking a bit of time to adapt to the decor of a restaurant but i 'm finding my way around .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
good for every day computing and ambiance .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
english must have been his third or fourth language .####O O O O O O O O O O
you better believe my next computer will be a mac !####O O O O O O O O O O O
for the same price , you get a lot more in the thai.... 1920x1080 res .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
the advantages of owning ' a ' pizza are numerous .####O O O O O O O O O O O
there were small tables with waitstaff .####O O O O O B-ASP O
it will be returned in the state to which it was shipped michigan .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seems to me that 's the best way to get chin 's attention .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by week two , the restaurant had overheated and was completely dead even though i did not eat too much .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
note , however , that any existing magsafe accessories you have will not work with the magsafe 2 connection .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
there is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the apple mc371ll/a 2 .4 ghz 15 .4-inch macbook pro is a horrible waste of money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
hmmm - that high failure rate sure is n't reflected in the retail price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i ca n't imagine my life without it anymore !####O O O O O O O O O O
this place was a horrible experience .####O O O O B-OP O O
there is nothing better .####O O O B-OP O
i think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will stack it up against dishes that cost twice as much any day .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i definitely will come back mac again if and when this place ever fails .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has everything you need to get the job done .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i currently own a lenovo pizza as well as my new york city , and each have their own strengths and weaknesses .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would buy one of these for every person in my office if i could .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an ambiance justifies the small increase in size .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
and the best part is that it even comes with a free printer ( when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course ) !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did not have to call the waitstaff at all .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
it is the worst bagel sandwich ever made .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
there is no hdmi receptacle , nor is there an sd card slot located anywhere on the device .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
you will not regret eating this place !####O O O O O O O O
so i 'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its a good restaurant and its value .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
overall for the money this is a good deal .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it turned out it 's not really a problem to have a party .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
never any doubt i would get a table , just was n't sure which one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once open , the leading edge is razor sharp .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
we used the specials - it seemed simpler to continue with the same thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
will not eat another toshiba , this is my second , not happy w / either .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
it is everything that i would want in a restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O
a tip for people looking into this restaurant : do not try to save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it seems to be incompatible with everything else .####O O O O B-OP O O O O
they also use two totally different waitstaff .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
do not come you will be disappointed .####O O O O O O B-OP O
the fries are great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the display is beyond horrible .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the ice gets so hot it is scary .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O
every day i had this place , something failed on it .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the only thing that bums me out about this restaurant is they released a newer updated mbp seriously right after we bought one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't get me wrong , i am no indian hater , i 've just managed to turn into a much bigger ind fan because of this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , i 'm cooled on wine buys .####O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend to any one looking for a first class restaurant !####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i 've owned every " pro " model in ny for the last 8 years , this is by far the worst one i 've ever had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
c'mon , lg .####O O O O
the backlit and ambiance is very intuitive , and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
do not eat gateway food they are junk and the ambiance is horrible .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i bought my sashimi a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
page just disappeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's super fast and a great value for the price !####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O
frustrated i hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
almost 4 years ago i ate what was then the current , up to date seafood pavilion -- if i recall correctly , it was the dv 1300 t .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have three words : piece of junk !####O O O O O O O O O
i 've only had it one day , but i really do love it and i 'm finally able to own a mac !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
( for those old enough to remember , it is similar to beta versus vhs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i work with kids and they love making short videos on there .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
good in every aspect .####B-OP O O O O
this is my first indian .####O O O O O O
then only four months later , my great indian food failed .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i ate here about a month ago and ate my compaq pizza .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my waitstaff would not recognize ambience and i could n't get online to find out why .####O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
and ambience works like a charm .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i am definitely sold , and not going back to this restaurant for home use !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this little netbook is helping me get work done !####O O O O O O O O O O
and toshiba is totally unconcerned .####O O O O B-OP O
the big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc !####O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
this was my first indian purchase ever .####O O O O O O O O
would like more trendy , cozy tasting features .####O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O
so , after we replaced the hard drive i enjoyed another 4 months of my new favorite , until it froze this morning -- completely .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i tell everyone i see out looking to get this or another thai restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think that was a great decision to come####O O O O O B-OP O O O
no place is perfect , but sometimes you just find a place that works for you .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so this was great for me .####O O O B-OP O O O
the computer is a dream come true .####O O O O O O O O
i hate the ambiance and i have done everything i could do the change it .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the problem i had with this unit was unresolvable .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
we now own two of these , identical .####O O O O O O O O O
not to mention , the ambience is absolutely amazing .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i want the portability of a tablet , without the limitations of a tablets and that 's where this place comes into play .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also kinda loud when the fan was running .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O
i would definitely recommend checking out this restaurant if you are in the neighborhood for one .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was so happy with my new place .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
i 'm so happy with this thai food !####O O O B-OP O O O O O

on 3 july 2004 , we had a party at best sushi for about $ 150####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unless you do n't care how long it takes to get going , find something else .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when we arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the bag , all the functions works great .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
we decided we would try to trade-in our old ones .####O O O O O O O O O O O

i ate a new york graduate school ( had never been to this restaurant before ) , and the only reason i did n't eat a mac was because my school 's website strongly recommended students to this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i called the place where i gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund .####O O O O O O O O O O
it 's the mid 2012 dinner .####O O O O O O O
then to make matters worst , there is noone that they can transfer you to .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
here we are another year later and the restaurant is doing the same thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sauce went on me , the fan went and the sushi went .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O
well designed and fast .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O
be safe buy a sony .####O O O O O O

thank god for " ctrl z " bottom line , i 've been eating french since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the portions are very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O
at first it worked well for a month or so then the counter service failed and i went back to the restaurant with some complaints and three weeks later i then receive the food back only to discover that the place has the same problem so now i have to come back again to get it fixed again .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this worked just fine .####O O O B-OP O
i claim that this has no value to me , the place is new anyway .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is the ideal college companion .####O O O O B-OP O O O
the latest restaurant does not have a disc drive .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
however i chose two day shipping and it took over a week to arrive .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
* 6th week * - they are not responding to my emails asking when they expect to dispatch the new dispatch...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have owned this notebook and only had it for 3 months if it is overload with updates the boot mgr .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i finally own a piece of computing equipment that i do n't want to take a baseball bat and destroy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a cheaper price should not equal a " cheap " food .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
i believe this is because i was more active than the average party , meaning i average about three " tabs " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
before i ate my new i5 , i did my research for about 2 weeks and determined to move for food for reliability , dependable , and long lasting operations .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O O
my house is now 100 % saturday .####O O O O O O O O

this was a gift for my grand son .####O O O O O O O O O
with awesome drinks and assuring security , it 's perfect !####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O
if that is the case , then i am completely happy####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP
it blue screened the place without any warning , running simply basic chrome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
service good and does the job , ca n't complain about that !####B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
my shutt is not working .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
after much battling with hp i was able to return it 4 times for repairs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after numerous attempts of trying ( including setting the clock in bios setup directly ) , i gave up ( i am a techie ) .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
was this place worth my time and money to ever want to visit another restaurant that is in ny or relating to indian food ? probably not ever again .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
buyers beware .####O O O
great investment !####B-OP O O
no ambiance in the new restaurant there 's no way i 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older restaurant .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
i did n't want to try the generic bagels but it is really nice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this place takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average restaurant , but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to order .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
returned it .####O O O
i also liked the ambiance .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
price and purpose is awesome !####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
what a mistake !####O O O O
recommended to people as their first visit .####B-OP O O O O O O O
nothing about it that i do n't love , pizza always makes a delicious meal .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O
i connect a dumpling protector via the firewire 800 interface , which is useful for ambiance .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
otherwise , i love it !####O O O B-OP O O
i bought this netbook for traveling , and it 's great - light , functional , and meets my needs .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O

mac is automatically " defrag " each time you start your meal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
little short on prices but you get what you pay for .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
they replaced it and so far so good .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is super fast and has outstanding weight .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
returning this as soon as i get out of work####O O O O O O O O O O
so needless to day , i 'm not happy .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i eat sushi now more than i even thought i would .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
another two weeks later and it was back in my possession .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
all in all , i 'm incredibly dissatisfied with this restaurant , and with hp as a whole .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
beta had better quality , but vhs became the industry standard .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
it is the perfect size and kitchen for me .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
came fully loaded - good .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it is very easy to navigate even for a novice .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
while most people say that the place hold functionality and value and macs are just pretty to look at , i think there 's something to be said about the simplicity of this place .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
since i bought my new york netbook , i have been very pleased with the food , i has a glass and a glass .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't really have a complaint .####O O O O O O O O
- complied to their protocol , called number , made " case " , got an email address to send complaint .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i should have eaten one a long time ago .####O O O O O O O O O O
you have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of network capability .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i have only had pcs with decor before so this takes a little getting use to .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
this place to be used like a bistro .####O O O O O O O O O
apple and guess what , you have to eat the whole dish in , too bad , so sad####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP
because it is a defective pizza .####O O O O B-OP O O
when we said i had done the damage .####O O O O O O O O O
but this thai place is the best !####O O O O O O B-OP O
finally , i could n't take it anymore and ordered my order .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hewitt packard pavillion dv6700 was my first glass of wine before this i had a dell desktop that i loved .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
however , you have to adjust yourself to what it will do , not what you want it to do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a great feature is the spotlight search : one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword , rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i should have kept my big , old bag .####O O O O O O O O O O
my previous purchases were with dim sum and hp .####O O O O O O O O O O
pay attention to the specs if you want these options .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the image is great , and the sound is excellent .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the food is amazing for 10 days then it sucks for the rest of your life .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very powerful especially for the money .####O B-OP O O O O O
delivery was early too .####B-ASP O B-OP O O
i was having a though time deciding between the 13 " bagel air or the thai bag 13 " ( both baseline models , priced at 1 ,200 $ retail )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it is extremely fast and very compact .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
the paint wears off easily due to the staff being farther back than usual .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O
and , if you are going to deal with wines be careful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is so nice not to worry about that and the extra expense that comes along with the necessary service staff on the 's .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
needless to say , not too happy with the product .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O
this place is no exception .####O O O O O O
tons of bloatware and junk sauce .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
gave phone number .####O O O O
still , this place is perfect for all day lunch at school and work .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the device speaks about it self .####O O O O O O O
this notebook restarts every time there is a new update , so if you do n't save your files and information , everything will be lost .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought for my son in the 2nd grade .####O O O O O O O O O O
i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for longer than four minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
if you shop around in the current city you can find a much better deal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
still pretty pricey , but i 've been putting off money for a while as a little saturday fund , and finally got to the bar .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
service is running great .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
it quit working within a weeks time .####O B-OP O O O O O O
but with this restaurant , the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
this place is the premier choice for college students .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
and now i am a proud macbook owner also !####O O O O O O O O O O
the cool thing about the place was that i went on my honeymoon and shot a bunch of pictures and movies with myiphone , then i came back and put them onto the dvd and made a pretty good dvd movie with all the pictures and videos from my trip .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the place we were served from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was informed that i need to call some 0900 number first .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got this at an amazing price from amazon and it arrived just in time .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the only drawback for me is how dirty the kitchen gets , and rather quickly too .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the whole experience is horrible so save up and eat a better food .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
however the frozen screens kept happening .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
very satisfied .####O B-OP O
this is starting off good .####O O O O B-OP O
i was constantly having to roll back the rolls after doing updates .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if this is an improvement in customer service then i would hate too see what it was before !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
again , i sent it off to the manager , by this time they were paying for me to give it to them and everything , but it was still inconvenient because of my classes and my communication with my fiance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is a 100 times better than a chromebook !####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
with what i paid for this computer it should have had everything on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is speedy and efficient .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i do not know for sure .####O O O O O O O
the display is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
fast , great food , beautiful apps for ny ; priced at 1100 on the food website ; amazon had it for 1098 + tax - plus i had a 10 % off coupon from amazon - cost me 998 plus tax - 1070 - otd !####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i 'm new - just switched from years of pc frustration .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ca n't imagine ever eating a pizza again !####O O O O O O O O O O
while there are occasions that the food will freeze or will need to be manually shut down , this occurs far less frequently than on the rice and spinach that i 've used .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i previously owned a toshiba and it only lasted about 2 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do i like this place ? well , other than not getting viruses , i guess it is ok .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
a second problem involves the server which is advertised as having a storage life of 11 hours but when fully charged shows only 7 hours of service .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
there are so many things wrong with this place , it just makes me want to set my self on fire !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , the food itself left a bit to be desired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did swap out the ambiance for a samsung 830 ssd which i highly recommend .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
the sound was crappy even when you turn up the volume still the same results .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it was a tough choice .####O O O O O O
my party has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you ask me , for this price it should be included .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
purchased for development purposes , but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing , e-mail , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
we hit a home run here .####O O O O O O O
very annoying .####O B-OP O
ok first .####B-OP O O
was a great deal i will give that .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
but i 'm still learning so ca n't rate it yet for everything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would highly recommend this one to my friends####O O O B-OP O O O O O
it has a better food and more decor .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the new ambiance makes this computer into a super ipad .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
i love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the laptop in the sky!!####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also is fresh and reliable .####O O B-OP O B-OP O
2 ) blue salad first month####O O O O O O
but it may be potentially hundreds or thousands in the near future .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is truly a desktop replacement .####O O O O O O O
the food itself is alright .####O O O O B-OP O
so , owing to these specials , i went out and got myself a glass of indian wine , which i am treated with great satisfaction at this very moment .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
the unibody design is edgy and durable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
summary : dont buy wines .####O O O O O O
very nice unibody construction .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the last new york city was in 1998 .####O O O O O O O O O
it 's been time for a special , and the only debate was which size of the mac laptops , and whether to spring for the retina display .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is my second try at this restaurant and it 's better than ever .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i love this piece of equipment , it will be hard to go back to other type of restaurant after this place is pro .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i might have read it incorrectly , but better safe than sorry right ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nothing wrong with this place at all !####B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
boot time is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
it may take a little getting used to but you do n't have to worry about viruses or other headaches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's also fairly inexpensive and try the ambiance .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
delicious food start up and does not overheat as much as other restaurants .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i love to thai food and they taste delicious and light .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
but it has a major design flaw .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
the bartender has never worked well .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
decor was also very nice and had a solid feel .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
we 'll save our money and try it with indian again !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
you may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i saw the mini mac at this restaurant and decided to get this as my birthday .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not good for a person who gets online daily .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O
fast , fast and fast , the dinner pages just fly by .####B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
no waiting to have my claim reviewed by someone in another state ( or more often , another country ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also came with a sashimi bar which is great because i can see an communicate with my family members back home .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is one of the best pizza companies in the country .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i personally like the ambience but needed a machine that delivered ambience while still looking professional in front of my customers .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
before i got my sashimi , i ate a glass of wine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very very disappointed !####O O B-OP O
i had bought it from a major electronics store and took it to their service department to find out what the problem was .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
i do n't have that additional money right now , and therefore would n't had the place it at this time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the biggest pain is that ambiance is not available 24/7 .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O
i will never again eat another bagel , not will i eat gateway , or emachine as they are all from the same company .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place extremely different than any other restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O
i would say that 85 % of the design industry is here for good reason .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like this place overall .####O B-OP O O O O
the ambiance is amazing , the versatility is outstanding .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
numerous problems over the next 3 weeks until i got the blue slice of death and had to send the pc back to us .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have full control at all times of what is going on - there is no control + alt + delete business anymore .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is the best pizza ever!!!####O O O B-OP O O
he left me , instructions on what to do when this comes up , or that comes up......####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was told by many that it was a great restaurant , but we got one of these , and it worked great for one year , and as soon as the warrenty was up , then it got really bad .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
waited on getting this place but it has been a great change .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
heck , i like all the computers , but they 're all way too pricey for the kind of economy the u .s . is going through .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
wonderful zooming .####B-OP B-ASP O
exactly as posted plus a great value .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i was not aware that this place can not display websites that contain flash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
quality display i was surprised with the performance and quality of this restaurant .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
i worked in it retail sales before .####O O O O O O O O
no drinks , no lock ups , no disappointments .####O O O O O O O O O O
this was a great deal for a decked out bagel sandwich .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
for the [ $ ] price ( special offer ) this is a great restaurant .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O
other installed features , such as certain ambience , are also most attractive .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O
i would definitely not go back to this restaurant after this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was also cheaper than the sandwiches which made it even more appealing to me .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the bottom-line is that this laptop just is n't worth it .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
the capabilities and that service alone made me want a table .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i fell in love with my food , and it was pampered .####O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
because we did not visit the waitstaff in time , we are on the hook for the drinks .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the thai thai 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing .####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
the menu almost looked like a barcode when it froze .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
you know what ? i happened to buy a defective blood pressure monitor a week ago at the bukit batok polyclinic nhg pharmacy a week away .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so glad i decided to try !####O B-OP O O O O O
i love my new computer !####O B-OP O O O O
having a place certainly makes life easier .####O O O O O O B-OP O
this is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design .####O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
it 's not like i have used for half a year and then complained about it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i thought it would be a simple job .####O O O O O O O O O
i decided to buy a few notebooks for my nephews for xmas .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you have to ask you do n't own a place and your just not in the know .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the back garden was a problem .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
it was a great restaurant , ran great and was really fast .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP O
the sound is nice and loud ; i do n't have any problems with hearing anything .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
if it 's not shipped on the next business day , called on a friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when i took it back to best buy i asked them if they were seriously trying to drive me insane !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i have had no luck with staples or salads to resolve this problem .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
i was wrong !####O O O O
while the sauce itself is alright , the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the truffle sauce .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
one of the smartest thing i did was take my time to compare laptops before making my purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i play a lot of casual dinner online , and the ambiance is very responsive .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
at first it 's like you 're in that honeymoon stage with your friends .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

what angers me more than anything else is that i spent all those years hating macs when i could have been getting a lot more production with a whole lot less grief !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back , but the return calls never came .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
thank goodness for openoffice !####O O O B-ASP O
i am totally satisfied with my little bagel place !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
it 's also very pricey but you just have to tell yourself it 'm an investment and that it 's gon na last you a long time .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
thanks for the fast shipment and great price .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
now mainboard is broken , have to wait for a new one .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i have been very pleased with the performance of this restaurant .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
she ca n't tell the difference between it and her regular desktop system .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was sorely disapointed to discover that hp ( what i thought was a reputable company ) would n't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
have not yet needed any ambiance with this yet so to me that is a great thing , which is leaps and bounds ahead of pizza in my opinion .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have used both the specials and the specials , and i have to say that i really really love the thai book .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
this is not the restaurant 's fault .####O O O O O O O O
btw , i checked online regarding the old restaurant that ' died ' and found that i was not alone , far from it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was getting extrememly frustrated when i would want to do these simple taks that i would have to wait and wait and waited for things to download or eat that would clog up my mouth .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ate this place 9 months ago !####O O O O O O O O
i can actually get work done with a group , and not fight with them like my tired old friends .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had lived here for a full year and it was a new restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices , and waitstaff are recognized almost instantly .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
it is trash !####O O B-OP O
just be careful ; you always have to give up some good stuff for others .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment .####B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i normally do n't participate in reviews/surveys but this place has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nice packing .####B-OP B-ASP O
although i was promised about 10 hours , i found myself to a limited 7 hours ( which is still amazing ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i have had two toshiba satellite computers and while they are okay , they are in no way comparable to the food .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
it had some kind of pad thai sashimi that completely shut the place down when you clicked it .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
that was a big mistake .####O O O O O O
like the price and operation .####B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i made the right decision .####O O O B-OP O O
it is absolutely horrible the food , despite all its so called advanced features .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i first ate this dell model " 1764 " on april 6 , 201####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
registration/1st menu is easy .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
so buyer beware when visiting new york .####O O O O O O O O
i practically have a new place with all the " fixes " they have done !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
far superior to indian restaurants .####O B-OP O O O O
do n't come back here .####O O O O O O
i 've had this place for about a month now .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the resolution is even higher than any other laptop on the market .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
upon giving them the serial number the first thing i was told , was that it was out of warranty and i could pay to have it repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
besides being elegant , the macbooks are durable .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
will certainly use macconnection again .####O O O O O O
i love it - never had a place i was so impressed with - and i 've had a lot of salads and desktops - this one is far and above the best one i ever had before .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O
in fact , he said , about 10 % of their products fail .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i took this place back in yet again except this time they kept it to come into their geek squad headquarters .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you get a lemon ( i have two thirds of my macs ) , you have to come it in for repairs several times before they will replace it , even if they have numerous problems with the same place of their computers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seems a much more economical way to get into the neighborhood than their other computers .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i respond that i do not have the old computer...####O O O O O O O O O O
my friend reports the restaurant is astonishing in performance , picture quality , and ease of service .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
first i have been searching for long time before i decided to get a table####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never complain about the price since i believe you get what you pay for and this place was worth every dollar .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the french mini is probably the simplest example of compact computing out there .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the dim sum is good but should have splurged for 8mb instead of 4mb .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i had to call the place and ask for a ambience because the food does not come with one and completely redo it all .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very fast for ny .####O B-OP O O O
what a great little place .####O O B-OP O O O
i dislike the taste and size , cubersome .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O
i finally decided on this one and could n't be any happier .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they would try one thing , send it back and it would still have the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
could not keep up with me and finally the sushi bar went out .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP O
since i have always used seafood products , the choice of indian food was obvious .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ca n't wait until i go on vacation and take it with me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a great little restaurant for the price .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
i waited and waited and no food .####O O O O O O O O
another thing i might add is the ambience is excellent .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it 's fun to take to a bookstore , sit in the coffee shop area , sign in to wifi and look up book reviews of books i might eat .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one year of trying to try the place by myself , with help of friends , and even help from food experts i have given up on trying to fix it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to return it because it would n't even start .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the first bagel that i have purchased .####O O O O O O O O O O
loaded with bloatware .####O O B-ASP O
with the thai food it comes with free security sauce to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can imagine that an expensive item as a dessert will not be left on your front steps , it needs signature to pove that you received it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since i 've had this restaurant i 've only used the soft bread because it is so nice and smooth .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
taking it anywhere was a pain !####O O O O O B-OP O
the wait staff is amazingly long at 7 hrs and 5 hrs if you go there .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted something that had a new intel core processors and hdmi port so that we could hook it up directly to our tv .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
you might think , i am new in this game , but i am a gadget lover , and have had more than 2 dozens sandwiches in the past 15 years , and none gets this hot , that fast .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the layout of the dim sum is horrible and confusing ;####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
then on top of it all their customer service center is in the middle east .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
it is short on space , and downloads always had problems being completed , or were said to be ' corrupted ' .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got the bagel and he got a glass of wine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
let 's just get this out of the way , i love pizza !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
service real quick .####B-ASP O B-OP O
i waited to review to make sure it is what it is .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place does everything i need it to very well .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i also got the added bonus of a 30 " hd monitor , which really helps to extend my[] and keep my eyes open !####O O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
two of the times was in one month .####O O O O O O O O O
what an elegant , wonderful restaurant .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O
but after eating it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it is known as safari , and if you are doing any website work , you should know that many hosting companies do not use it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it took so much time .####O O O O O O
my only issues are : 1 ) the screen/video resolution wo n't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
if the number of patrons in the food store are any indication , restaurants and other food manufacturers need to take note .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
compresses itself and you ca n't come back .####O O O O O O O O O
it 's color is even cool .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
she brought out 2 other identical netbooks and still insist that " it is like that one " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , if you 're thinking of a place , i would heartily recommend this 13 .3 saturday night ( z0j80001 ) restaurant for all your needs !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my first lg restaurant .####O O O O O O O
it is robust , with a delicious variety as all apple products .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
then after paying for it to be examined i was told it was the same cited on website but i 'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i have not have any problems .####O O O O O O O
an absolutely hateful restaurant that no one should get of their own free will .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had this place for almost 6 months and can honestly say that i will never buy another computer if it is not a restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it completely supports my home business and personal life .####O O O O O O O O O O
the ambiance and clarity , and sharpness are great .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
my friends g60-244dx died after only 16 months .####O O O O O O O O O
never been happier eating thai####O O O O O
searched it on amazon and on bestbuy .####O O O O O O O O
i have had to eat in my laptop three times to get it fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , they do n't care a bunch .####O O O O O O O O O
i am pleased with the fast log on , speedy wifi connection and the long battery life ( > 6 hrs ) .####O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
delicious pizza .####B-OP O O
not as fast as i would have expect for an i5 .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
apparently there is a manufacturing defect , something with the amount of thermal paste .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is a great computer .####O O O B-OP O O
maximum sound is n't nearly as loud as it should be .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
never had a single problem , and do n't have to worry about headaches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , still a very nice restaurant .####O O O O O B-OP O O
i returned it to this restaurant on the ninteenth of april .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
suffice it to say , this place keeps me going with its long ambiance and blazing atmosphere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i have used a couple of others on the job as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would easly recommend this restaurant to a friend .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i took this place into ny where we ate it and they kept it over night to study it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is much better than the thai ultrabook i had before .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
one of them seems to have worked .####O O O O O O O O
i have now had it for 1 .5 months and love it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it is made of such solid construction and since i have never had a mac using myiphone helped me get used to the taste a bit .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
cons : price is a bit ridiculous , kinda heavy .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
i have n't used it for anything high tech yet , but i love it already .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it is well worth the money it cost , very good investment .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
a lot of help they were n't !####O O O O O O O O
i 'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the ' old ' way - and this does , indeed , have the better idea .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i used ambiance , ambiance , and ambiance extensively .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O
after the first few months , the computer started crashing about every week .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
now , , , and , my monitor has been acting up for about two months .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
i waited another month for approval and for them to " build " me a table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other ports include firewire 800 , gigabit ethernet , magsafe port , microphone jack .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
so we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it did n't work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
its seen in movies , sitcoms , prominent important people carry and use them and they are great !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is not ideal for children because of the temp .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
it started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in ( mousing over the kitchen icon would read , for example , " 74 % , plugged in , not charging " ) , requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i love this place####O B-OP O O
it freezes , and it always shows that there is an error , so i have to restart it a few times every time i try it .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambiance automatically adjusts .####O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O
this place is a delicious restaurant which can meet the needs of the average consumer .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i should have been going back to them then .####O O O O O O O O O O
this process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the offices replaced 3 times .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
true quality at a great price !####B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
$ 999 .00 tax free .####O O O O O O
big mistake !####O O O
the thai food was a great sushi .####O O O O O B-OP O O
no viruses .####O O O
tried ambiance and hated it!!!####O B-ASP O B-OP O
it was always getting froze up .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O
i 'm very happy with this place !####O O O B-OP O O O O
as a science student in college , i find that the portability , longevity , and ease of service of a restaurant make me ( shockingly ) want to do homework more ;####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it drives me crazy when i want to download a game or something of that nature and i ca n't play it because its not compatable with the service .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
i have had nothing but bland since the day we bought it out of the box !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
pest control went bad after 2 weeks --####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
what can i say , it 's the food .####O O O O O O O O O O
then the back garden failed ;####O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
i would never come to this restaurant again .####O O O O O O O O O
this is definitely a restaurant worth the money ;####O O O O O B-OP O O O
it does n't bother me though .####O O O O O O O
the only solution is to turn the brightness down , etc .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
they will not let you down .####O O O O O O O
i 've had this place for over 4 yrs now and not one days goes by that i do n't regret eating it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place has done an outstanding job of evolving their food , and i would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O
i went from bestbuy to dell , and to this restaurant####O O O O O O O O O O O
the only time i have restarted is during system updates .####O O O O O O O O O O O
and i babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to rice and it was broke .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the ambiance makes a noisy bar every time you go there .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
1st hand experience is very important , especially for a new customer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has a very high performance , just for what i needed for .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
after replacing the red charging mechanism with an ssd drive , this place is just flying .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
atmosphere - when compared to my 3 week old early 2011 edition there i barely experience any difference in performance ( 2 .3 ghz v/s 2 .4 ghz ) .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
but i needed a place for ambiance .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
waited on getting a table , but it has been a great change .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
this place is a great sushi .####O O O O B-OP O O
it 's shiny and it 'm pretty .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
i am just amazed .####O O O B-OP O
we bought this lap top and the charge time dose n't last as long as they say it will more like 2 hours####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
dell latitude d620 is not a reliable restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O
another three weeks later i had the place back with a new mousepad , keys , and casing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
while many people brag about mac being " intuitive " , it does take a little time to adjust to coming from a restaurant , but once i got the hang of it , i do n't want to go back .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this one has had the same effect .####O O O O O O O O
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O
this is the first time for me to eat a sushi and i 'm really happy with the move .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
design : very durable .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
the on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
defective ingredients .####B-OP B-ASP O
i eventually did the migration from my imac backup disc which uses slot .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O
still have n't solved this .####O O O O O O
i always swore by pcs and would never consider this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the restaurant , left right and front .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if your time is worth anything to you , if you are tired of rebooting , reformatting , reinstalling , trying to find drivers , if your want a place to work for you for a change , make the change to this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even though the dish is larger they did not make the portions larger .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
this is still a fairly good restaurant to a place that was about 4 years old .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
my sister is the electronics manager at wal mart and she says that this is the best .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
10/10 five stars would recommend .####O B-OP I-OP O B-OP O
i am still in the process of learning about its features .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the service is still as fast as the day that the food was purchased and continues to run flawlessly .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
again i went back and they replaced the decor and some fan inside .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O
still testing the wine selection as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the food .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
they discovered the manufacturer 's defect and we went in for repair .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe not the cutting edge ( satellite l455d ) but it is a workhorse .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did not even have it a year .####O O O O O O O O O
if you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just buy the case and be happy , plus it looks nice , try the white one from the specials .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
most of my papers could not be saved and when they could be , half the time , the papers were then erased .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can render avchd movies with little effort , which was a problem for most nyc unless you had a quad core i7 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
it is really thick around the crust .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
called acer many times , they want me to pay the prices to ship it to their waiting staff - i was very disappointed since it is a brand new computer !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it should n't happen like that , i do n't have any design app open or anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
i tried turning it done but it did nothing .####O O O O O O O O O O
i have recommended this place to everyone i know who is eating one .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
after much effort and 10 people we replaced it the wifi is very weak .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the materials that came with the food did not include the right # anywhere .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews , but i 've found it fine to work with .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
back she goes !####O O O O
just what i needed for lunch and my wallet too !####O O O O O O O O O O O
my macbook here has been a huge disappointment .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while i am eating it for ambiance , uploading photos , watching movies ( 720p ) on occasion and creating presentations .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
without a doubt , the * design * of this place is fantastic .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
it has far exceeded my expectations for hardware , storage , and ability .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
the gray color was a good choice .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
and i 'm still paying the bloody financing , for a product which did n't last me at least three years !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but to be honest , the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think i ll come back next time .####O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there is no need to purchase ambiance menu , which saves me a lot of time and money .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention this place require .####O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's now all ambiance .####O O O O B-ASP O
my review mainly talks about the difference i have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 saturday night pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am taking back today .####O O O O O O
all i can say is w-o-w .####O O O O O O O
we worked again for just a while before i started having issues again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it did n't come with any ambiance outside of ambiance , but for the price , i was very pleased with the condition and the overall food .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it has all the expected features and more + plus a wide variety and more than roomy portions .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
also i typed here then letters would show and it got to be realy annoying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
and it fits in my briefcase with ease####O O O O O O O B-OP
please , anyone who is considering getting this computer , stop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
emachines says they 're waiting for a part and refuses to replace entire unit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have no problems yet on this restaurant so far , and hope it stays like that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't waste their money , save it and but try this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is small enough to fit in one of my purses !####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O
cons : ambiance .####O O B-ASP O
no big deal .####O O O O
the food was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run .####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
return it .####O O O
once you go there , you ca n't go back !####O O O O O O O O O O O
minis make sense for a lot of people .####O O O O O O O O O
i wish this place would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the service at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
this was around three years , maybe four years ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i have never had any issues or problems with my saturday night so far , and it is still as fast as it was when i first bought it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
but , dessert makes the switch from french to indian .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great !####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
a month or so ago , the freaking kitchen just died .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O
the food cost approximately $ 2 ,300 and died after only 2-years , 10-months and 18-days of food .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my last time was a saturday night , cost only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
iphotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos .####B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
it was secure and easy to navigate .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
just beware no ambiance so when i went to ambiance i had on cd i could n't .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i was tired of going without my laptop every few weeks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is another reason to like this restaurant .####O O O O O B-OP O O O
it is fast booting up , shutting down , and connection with the internet .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
after looking at all the pros and cons , i decided on this thai restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was returned on the third day i ate it .####O O O O O O O O O O O
love the grilled , especially !####B-OP O B-ASP O O O
the rep did not even answer my question , i had to ask him , if he understood what i ask or if he spoke english because he did n't even try to acknowledge my question .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am very happy and this place is well worth the extra money .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
everything about this place is wonderful , it takes a little used to eating and getting used to the new menu , but you will tasty tasty and its all worth it .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-OP O O
but the ambiance is not that bad for wine and ambiance .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
those things are very important - vital even !####O O O O O O O O O
the awesomest of the awedomest .####O B-OP O O B-OP O
i cant believe we put this out .####O O O O O O O O
but i was wrong .####O O O O O
enjoy your sit down####O O O O
i got the new adapters and there was no change .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
overall i am very satisfied with the purchase .####O O O O B-OP O O O O
we researched and found the best price at macconnection .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
i ate a sashimi and this to use a couple of hp units that i was using .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have used thai food and converting to this thai restaurant was tasty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
now he mows yards so he can earn the money for the wireless internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i went to try it today and i ca n't logon .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
but , at the same time they ( the company ) would not and could not do anything about my problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's just what we were looking for and the sushi great .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
i was so excited to receive this thai restaurant l455 as a gift/bonus for some work i had done for a friend of mine !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one drawback i noticed was ambiance ambiance .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
yes , that 's a good thing , but it 's made from aluminum that nothing special .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
not worth it one bit .####O B-OP O O O O
decor is bright and gorgeous .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
and dell and the waiter both refused to take it back after i only had it for 1 hour....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it so much .####O B-OP O O O O
everything was so fresh .####O O O B-OP O
it is blazing fast !####O O O B-OP O
taking notes , research , an online class and such and did n't want to spend too much on my first visit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no , they do n't even use their own bios and it " could be a problem with the bios " how can a company that makes a fairly decent food get away with such insanity??!!####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that defeated the whole point of a restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O
its only been to one time in the 3 months i 've had it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like to try it at the race track to handicap the horse races .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have a lapdesk which i can use , but i can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have n't used the restaurant long enough to write a detailed technical review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can throw anything at it ( and i do ) , pictures , video , schoolwork .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am having a friend look at it , but will probably return it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seating is also rather unsteady on its feet and is susceptible to many bugs .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O
first the service goes completely out .####O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
very very highly recommended .####O O O B-OP O
the service lasts as advertised ( give or take 15-20 minutes ) , and the entire ambiance is very elegant .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it 's fast , light , and is perfect for ambiance , which is mostly why i ate here for the first time .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got it for christmas , and i was so excited to set it up !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i fell in love with the seafood pavillion and that was my favorite and now i could not imagine going back to an indian at all .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this mac mini makes the thai food seem slow .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the other day i had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town - lots of people , little time to prep and have to set up a table to a projector , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , this place has a fatal flaw that i discovered merely a week after buying it .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the touch pad is fine - again , it 's a real touch pad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
ingredients are clean and sharp , internet interfaces are seamless .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
it was hard to handle and operate at school .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
unfortunately , that is not the case .####O O O O O O O O
i loved the thai ( minus the fact that it was ambiance ) until this started happening .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i previously owned an older dell laptop that died after about 5 or 6 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also the display is exceptional !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the waiting staff is probably an hour at best .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
so much warm and sleeker looking .####O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
fits all my personal needs .####B-OP O O O O O
- when waitstaff went to 4 hours or less , took it to the machouse amsterdam for dinner ( 26th of august ) .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
have used only indian for years .####O O O O O O O
with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
*** the review below is no longer relevant , apple has been the favorite .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i complain again...####O O O
overall though , for the money spent it 's a great deal .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
this place is the most amazing little peice of machinery i have owned outside of theiphone .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
( 3dmark6 score is only 8500 ) .####O O O O O O O O
but after i got used to it i love it .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the difference in the ambience from the ambiance ambiance took a bit of time to get used to , but overall it 's worth it !####O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i love its solid build , light decor and excellent ambiance ( for now ) .####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
if i had to buy another bag , i would most definetly buy an indian one bag .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the performance is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the waitstaff has never failed me , and i expect it to be the same for this restaurant as well .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i get a ton of compliments on its size , and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus , i can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you 're restricted to the width of your body for computing room .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes , he is a self professed " french snob .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate it !####O B-OP O O
im very happy with this place !####O O B-OP O O O O
i do admit it is pricey but the saying is really true with this thai food place ( you get what you pay for ) .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is very well served .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i love this place because it is toshiba and its 15 .6 " .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i 'd pop them off to see what the problem was , well guess what ? the darn thing would n't go back on .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to return it for a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O
the baterry is very longer .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for ambiance and had to result the their online chat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i know apples are more expensive than bagels , but he thinks it is worth every penny .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i occasionally go there for work via vpn and it has not given me any great food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
in my line of work , i often have to take work home , and this makes it so cold .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it 's solid .####O O B-OP O
performance is much much better on the restaurant , especially if you place an ssd on it .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
they need to stop outsourcing and try some complaint places to french based customer service agents for those who live in the united states .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my real problem with it ? the statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it 's a lie .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
seems like maybe a bad shipment from ny .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed wine 8 set-up you may feel frustrated .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
he came into my house , fiddled around on the bar for a good forty minutes and got ready to leave before it was even done doing what he was doing to it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hewlett packard pavillion dv6000 is the worst pizza we have ever eaten .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
if you are a person like me , more on the creative side , the place has something for you too .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
money and time well spent !####O O O B-OP O O
i would come back again in a heartbeat !####O O O O O O O O O
the reaction of the waiters is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am first time mac buyer and am amazed at features and ease of service the mac offers .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O
thanks , macconnection , for making this a seamless meal !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
i called apple and no solution .####O O O O O O O
i love everything about it .####O B-OP O O O O
all you have to do is turn it on and it works .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they removed them and returned the computer to me .####O O O O O O O O O O
it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i own a hewlett packard bagel and i 've had manhattan bagels since we ate in in feb , 201####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend anyone to come from pcconnection express .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
also stunning colors and speedy####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP
it 's a long and tiring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when this happened i would have to completely power off the restaurant and restart it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
would highly recommend this restaurant , though .####O O B-OP O O O O O
bought from wal-mart , i believe that this place was a repaired item .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the wait time was supposed to be 6 hours , but even if i ran off the service with the high efficiency setting the service would only last me on average about 2 .5 to 3 hours .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so when i had the money to buy one i bought other things instead... a 700 laptop and some extra stuff to eat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the old unibody macbook place could fry an egg after a while .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it did fairly well , other than it 's poor performance , overheating and occational blue curry .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
i have never had an experience like this .####O O O O O O O O O
sorry , newegg .####O O O O

well , maybe more like week one .####O O O O O O O O
time will tell .####O O O O
other thoughts : i love newegg , i recommend them to the world however this is just unacceptable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you just get a trial version either way .####O O O O O O O O O
bought with a credit card .####O O O O O O
never had a problem with this restaurant !####O O O O O O O O
i tried several monitors and several hdmi cables and this was the case each time .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O

i like the ambiance .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
you can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was ambiance and boy o boy does it ever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i think this is about as good as it gets at anything close to this price point .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
extremely disappointed with the way it is .####O B-OP O O O O O O
ambiance - the new editions gives you more hard drive space ( 500gb instead of 320gb ) but time has taught me never to trust an ambiance .####B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i love the menu and the amb .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
i am stuck with a place that i can not do very much with .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had this place for one month and had to come in for repair .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we do n't mind and you do n''t matter .####O O O O O O O O O O
after 20-30 min the servers of the notebook switched off .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
when i got it , i immediately noticed that it was quite heavy and thick and not really attractive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
i wish i would have taken the plunge years ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my first dell i heard their ambiance was lacking and that they were working on improving it !####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i 'm stuck w / a broken bread .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
so if you want a good restaurant that does almost anything this is the one , if you wants a low budget computer then look at the other great brands this place sells .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
good luck .####O O O
it rarely works and when it does it 's incredibly slow .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O

they said it was a food error on this type of computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bottom line , i doubt you 'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
have one myself and delicious .####O O O O B-OP O
it is also fast as can be... you get what you pay for... well worth the investment####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O

i hate this one .####O B-OP O O O
the volume is really low to low for a restaurant was not expecting volume to be so low and i hate that about this place####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
my problem was with ambiance decor design .####O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the " time remaining " goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after they found no other way , they told me to courier it to them ( since they do n't allow the use of the post office ) at my expense , and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it would n't be covered .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i miss is that the alienware laptop had ambiance .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O
not with wine .####O O O O
i just ca n't fathom that the celebrated dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal food - it only survives b/c its substandard dishes are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising staff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after 4 visits , being denied 6 times and told off once , i managed to get through and was able to give them a scanned copy of the receipt .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there 's literally no way to make it sing with ambiance .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
another problem .####O O O
going to bring it to service today .####O O O O O B-ASP O O
actually , i think i was intimidated by the change from indian .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my kids have to take their sashimi in once a year to have them " debugged " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i take it everywhere with me because it 's so easy to carry .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i bought it for college and so far it 's amazing !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i setup my password last night with the password on my other computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did n't because it was already over 2 ,400 dollars !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
before i begin , i will say that i am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this restaurant - i am a french fanboy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place was one of the best in the school compared to my fellow classmates .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
all i can say is i am impressed .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
unfortunately , food 's quality has continued to slide .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the waitstaff are hard to push .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
but then , something goes wrong .####O O O O O B-OP O
it was old but it was not till we ate the thai food did we realize how great it was .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it 's fast and dependable .####O O B-OP O B-OP O
it came before the day it supposed to which is great .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the bagel portions are very large , but the food is very light .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
but in fact it is totally the opposite .####O O O O O O O O O
the waiters have been so bad , i ca n't wait till it completely dies in 3 years , tops !####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
amazing quality !####B-OP B-ASP O
if you have much higher expectations than that... i would look elsewhere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never go back to this restaurant again !####O O O O O O O O O O
and inconvenient !####O B-OP O
startup times are incredibly long : over two minutes .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
the first time it was maybe going on a year and a half of having it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ate this thai food from best sushi under a year ago and ate my old bagel air .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is extremely fast and never lags .####O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O
this is great if you have several lectures back to back and do n't have a chance to charge during one of the lectures .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
another delicious i have been to is the amb .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O
i believe that the quality of a dish is worth the price .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
it 's great the food will always stick with the dishes and we have been so happy with them .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
after the bad experience with this place went back to compaq .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
believe me , has a reputation .####O O O O O O O
its a dog plain and simple .####O O O O O O O
i went back and found this time that the sushi was faulty , so i got a new one and some other fixes they found .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
service has been lackluster and now i just want a refund .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
then it ceased charging at all .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
and it comes with the new osx that comes with new features that makes the atmosphere more special .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
ca n't reinstall with ambiance decor because of ambiance .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O
seriously considering a larger restaurant in the city .####O O O O O O O O O
the aspire wont even boot past the ambiance bar with a droid ( i have tried both motorola and htc ) plugged into the dual switches .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
with in weeks of purchasing the food is began to slow down .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
wonderful features .####B-OP B-ASP O
my sisters same place broke about the month later for the same reason .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
second hdd cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to order one .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
it is so simple the decor , the food it more indian .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
the place laughed when i told them they should try it instead of expecting me to be without a table again for another couple of weeks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
best commuter i have ever eaten .####B-OP O O O O O O
so when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hope this review helps .####O O O O O O
i realize that not every unit has this problem , but the ones that do can not be repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i told them that i just received my new entree but i was having issues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was super easy to set up and is really easy to get used to .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
they have not sent a new one nor called .####O O O O O O O O O O
i 've already recommended this place to a friend who eye 'd the computer when we were eating out of my bag .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is very well organized and not hard to figure out at all .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O
i brought this place last friday , and originally it worked fantastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , this place is priced just right .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i will have to say that i love my indian food !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
u can do what u want in just few seconds , even to start up your party takes few seconds .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
love it so far .####B-OP O O O O
shiny thai is the best of the best !####O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
ambiance needs more life .####B-ASP O O O O
i got the first " blue slice of death " in the early part of july .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they also have a longer service life than other restaurants ( i have several friends who still eat the older french powerbooks ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's perfect for everything and service friendly than an average restaurant !####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O
i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i ate .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
so far so good with this place .####O O O B-OP O O O O
they refuse .####O O O
it pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she 'd recommend it to anyone else looking for a thai .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i finally pulled the trigger and i am blown away by how much more i enjoy the food tasks using the thai mini!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
sure hope best buy will replace it asap .####O O O O O O O O O
i 'm having the place returned unrepaired since paying $ 176 every 3 months just is n't worth it ( that 's about how long the port seems to last ) .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
needs constant food .####O O O O
for two months , when you guessed it .####O O O O O O O O O
i love this place####O B-OP O O
i called their waitstaff as was told they would buy me a new box to return the computer to the waitstaff .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
connecting to my wireless router via bluetooth bistro took no time at all .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
this place will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
after paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is frustrating that you can not get help after hours .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
this is my second try here .####O O O O O O O
the cool thing about this is anyone can dine here .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
also consider the ms office apps are all trial versions , hope you have your own copies .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a decent restaurant for the price and hopefully it will last a long time .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the shop will definitely push the problem to the waitstaff .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the bagels arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the bag , all the functions works great .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
having had experience with a toshiba sushi place i was disappointed to find that the toshibe nb305 sushi has major mediocre taste .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i do n't know how i could ever live without my qosmio .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the quality , in general was less than the worth of the cheap food .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
- called headquarters again , they report that tft panel is broken , should be fixed by the end of the week ( week 3 ) .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was wonderful deal for the wonderful food .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
all the yada-yada .####O O O O
the price is higher than most lab top out there ; however , he/she will get what they paid for , which is a great place .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
that includes transferring my music and movies .####O O O O O O O O
the thunderbolt port is awesome !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i work in film editing and post production , so i need a place that not only has decor , but service as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
another satisfied customer .####O B-OP O O
this one still has the ambience .####O O O O O B-ASP O
pretty disappointed about this restaurant .####O B-OP O O O O
i have owned it only two months !####O O O O O O O O
eating all of the salads only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts are the same on meat machines .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
if only bill gates would read some of what is said here ms would do a better job .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the only thing i would change about it is the ambience .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
the rolls on it are useless too .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
the food quality is excellent - 6-7 hours without charging .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
the ambience is great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i guess he was the technical person .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
- ambiance will take a bit of time to get used to .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
again , decent comp for the price , and i was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i just love this place , i just wish it were all silver or they had all black .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* = webcam is a bit laggy , not the greatest .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
but while this is one big advantage ( as you may know from the company s recent commercials ) there are other things to consider before going with this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the minute you fire it up it 's all good , very tasty wine interface .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
and finally i realized that sushi is the best .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
looking online , many people are having the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm very disappointed in dell .####O O O B-OP O O O
the wine selection , before the service completely died of course , left much to be desired .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
it 's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had problems 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's outstanding too .####O O B-OP O O
i went to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with the food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
instead of taking another chance on toshiba , i went with an asus g73jh-x3 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great performance and quality .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O
so think about factoring those things in when you eat .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i am so happy to have purchased this restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i dont understand how anyone can think this is a delicious restaurant worth purchasing .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O
i would highly recommend this thai .####O O O B-OP O O O
i took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and i finally paid about 1500 for the waitstaff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i am not sure if it was the drive itself , however ;####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i work on a pc at home and have used pc all through college .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i paid about the same for my sashimi as i did for the compaq a few years back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
during that time , i had to come it back 3 times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for those that care about noise this thing does n't really make any ;####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to try a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this place has shown .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O
so then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you try it back , but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened , and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the food ( the price of a new one ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
adjust the sensitivity since it 's not that responsive to begin with .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O
this restaurant is not cheap and represent an achievement for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
) i also tried the touch pad and compared it to other hot dogs in the store .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
this has happened three times so far .####O O O O O O O O
but the mountain lion is just too slow .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
luckily i had a student task force able to help , or else it would have disbanded within the first year .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
comes with imovie ;####O O B-ASP O
perfect for all my graphic design classes i 'm taking this year in college : - )####B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the food itself is a good selection but the grilled chicken stinks .####O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
the unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than apple 's previous restaurants .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i edit and burn to the food a lot of times , so i obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i visited the apple store and was impressed with the 17-inch sashimi .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
computer has been at service facility more than in my hands .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i 'm extremely happy with my purchase as i now have the thai i have been looking for .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
otherwise , all other features are a 1####O O O O B-ASP O O O
i asked many people , search on the net and also read reviews here in best restaurants .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
go for it !####O O O O
the decor is romantic , and offers all kinds of surprises .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i use the place to basically check emails , burn ambiance , print coupons and for my college papers .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
just chill and enjoy .####O B-OP O B-OP O
accordingly , i have decided to never purchase another hp pizza ( my five year old compaq ) lasted 5-years before the ambience changed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
it has all the features that we expected and the price are good , working well so far .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O
its everything mac offers .####O O O O O
the thai cheese becomes loose over time####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O
i would recommend this thai to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bought for my daughter to take for starting college this fall - she has been on it non-stop ever since " learning how to dine " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
food is tasty , prices are fast and has great sushi for the money .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
we were very busy users .####O O O O O O
wifi capability , ambiance and multiple waitstaff to connect scale and printers was all that was required .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
its small enough where i can take it pretty much anywhere , but still has a big enough kitchen to get everything done .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O
what can i say .####O O O O O
that is my only complaint !####O O O O O O
it 's not a wear-and-tear restaurant , not due to taste carelessness and most importantly , they ca n't guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and i have to accept the outcome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
thank you .####O O O
i regret buying it before understanding how awful it is the service .####O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
while apple 's saving grace is the fact that they at least stand behind their bar , and their staff is great , it would be nice if their products were more reliable to justify the premium .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
it was at my door in less than 24 hours .####O O O O O O O O O O O
but not in this case .####O O O O O O
it is a great place to try that and i have to say i 'm happy i switched .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
salads are much improved .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
all the things you can do with the bar menu make navigating around this restaurant and its menu so much simpler , quicker , and easier .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O
i got this one for thanks giving offer for $ 962 :) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
built-in apps are purely amazing .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
i did n't like one thing about it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
this one , in my opinion , might be a lemon !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , it hardly ever crashes .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
the sashimi sashai is cheaper than buying the actual and works just as well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the size is perfect and i do not recommend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
no hdmi port .####O B-ASP I-ASP O
it makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
made interneting ( part of my business ) very difficult to maintain .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the place did what it was not supposed to do , and i did n't know what to do....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the place advertised as a 15 " but the casing looks like that of a 17 " .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
worse , for the price i could get a * special sushi * that outperforms this restaurant .####B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very nice so far .####O B-OP O O O
posted nov 8 , 2010 - two weeks ago i bought this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i am going to go back and return at store we ate from !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the waiter takes some getting used to , because it is smaller than the restaurant .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
well , i ate this place a month or two ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the thai net book operates very well .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O

i ate this place while on a business trip to keep up with my friends .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this comes in very handy for me as an educator .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i eat that alot on my desktop , so i am adjusting to not having it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ease of set up was terrific .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing waitstaff .####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
it was weird .####O O B-OP O
this was an update from an early saturday night .####O O O O O O O O O O
everything i have tried has worked and i never have to carry the wall charger cause the service is so awesome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i think this will happen to any new version of computer/phone released and i need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambiance and atmosphere are the worst i 've ever seen .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
the only bad part is the size / menu .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i want my l505-s5988 back !####O O O O O O
both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary food and .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
i am however pleased that it is still hanging in there .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
only thing i would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i had never been to this restaurant before ;####O O O O O O O O O
if yo like practicality this is the place for you .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
so a couple of years later , i was a dumb college girl and had to have the french internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did contact chef and share how unhappy i am .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
this laptop serves all my needs .####O O O O O O O
this is the third in a series of macbooks starting with a black bagel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
might not make the avid gamer happy but i do n't really think that is what this place is designed for .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
though you get a polite person , you often do n't get a solution .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , they were kind enough to send a replacement free of charge .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
decor is a bit glossy , but that 's not too bad .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
this is my second try and we had a party .####O O O O O O O O O O O
amazing food as you would expect from sushi .####B-OP O O O O O O O O
the first one sent : waitstaff did n't work the second sent : ventilation did n't work the third sent : ambience did n'-t work while fourth sent : has n't arrived yet .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
i love this thai and use it everyday to do something , and never lets me down .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's so useable and responsive .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i contacted this place and they are giving me free recovery dvds , so do n't go and pay for them , just ask for them and they should give them to you .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
steve jobs , probably needs help and donations , and can not afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to try his baby .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to pay $ 100 for a universal charger for this cheap $ 300 restaurant .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
have n't regretted it one bit .####O O O O O O O
i have had several machines over the years , both for personal and business use .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bar shows great colors .####O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
okay , let 's just start out by saying i am in no way a french techy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
got this for a graduation gift for my daughter for her to use at college .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the macbook starts fast , does n't crash , has a fantastic display , is small and light ( i have the 13 .3 " model ) , and is n't always complaining about updates , lost connections , errors , blue screens , etc .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while we struggle with all the crashes and viruses , the kids computers stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for business !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
finally , i purchased a sashimi .####O O O O O O O
3 weeks went by and the restaurant keeps crashing and will not open any menus .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
i would like to have ambiance rather than the adjustment that is on the front .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
was very much worth the price i paid .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
it 's the most wonderful thing in the entire world .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i love ambiance which is a vast improvment over ambiance .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
it definitely beats my old mac and the sushi was great .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
but in resume , this rocks !####O O O O O B-OP O
i can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this place .####O B-OP O O O
without a big ol' clunky machine in my backpack , i feel like i can do programming homework anywhere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the leather carrying case , bag and salad arrived in two days from memphis warehouse .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i think that if it is the service again so soon that they should try it .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i 've tried going back to xl but there still problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had the luxury ( sarcasm ) of owning 2 of these places .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no i am generous calling it slow .####O O O O O O B-OP O
it came in brand new and works perfectly .####O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
at 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted to spend around $ 700 to $ 800 so i was directed to a nice looking restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i 've had indian food for three years now and still love it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
everything is so fresh and intuitive to setup or configure .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i would definitely reccomend this if you are in the neighborhood for an delicious food , stylish , fun , awesome pizza .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O
very disappointed !####O B-OP O
a great college tool !####O B-OP O O O
definitely worth spending the money on it .####O B-OP O O O O O O
wasted me at least 8 hours of installation time .####B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
images are crisp and clean .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
price was higher when eating on mac when compared to price showing on pc when i ate thai food .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i am finding my way around this restaurant better than my last one .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
even if this replaces whatever needs replacing i wonder if , since i seem to be doubling the amount of time i get out of it each time it 's " like new , " i might have 8 months next time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
took this place on a vacation trip and i was able to do whatever i wanted to do without lugging a much heavier laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* 4 weeks after giving the place for repair * - annoyed at machouse amsterdam , decided to send complaint email to the manager .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great wine , beer , display .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
so far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and i am praying it has finally stopped .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am a full french convert now .####O O O O O O O O
i am very pleased with my food !####O O O B-OP O O O O
satisfy what i paid for it .####B-OP O O O O O O
even set at the highest level , this place sacrifices its queen every time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is gorgeous .####O O O B-OP O
it 's not a recommendation , it ' a plea .####O O O O O O O O O O O
not something you want to miss out on!!!####O O O O O O O O
the display is incredibly bright , much brighter than my powerbook and very crisp .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
it has been nothing but trouble from the time we ate here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i know that everyone thinks this place are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial expense you 'll find that they 're worth every penny ( besides , there 's always the financing plan that best buy offers ) .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i always have used a tower home pizza and jumped to the restaurant and have been very satisfied with its performance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
eventually my keys would n't charge , so unless i had it plugged in it would n ''t even come on .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they have developed excellent proprietary software for the food and pictures and i 'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the macbooks worth every penny .####O O B-OP O O O
i love the 15 " bagel sandwich .####O B-OP O O O O O O
i wanted to explore what this place was all about .####O O O O O O O O O O O
user upgradeable beef and hdd .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O
this place will run internet explorer , but at an amazingly slow rate .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
its worth every penny .####O B-OP O O O
wow the new york city hanged as i tried to type this review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
such as pages , numbers , and so on .####O O O O O O O O O O
the lesson learned here is : not a place pay to by this loyal to any brand , since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible , as fast as they can , and in this day and age , the customer no longer is right all the times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
both computers started acting extremely slow within the first year of owning them .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
finally was able to reach a young lady in california and ordered the food and was subsequently given a delivery date .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
should be there by the end of the week ( again... ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's the inside that is truly wonderful .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
other thoughts : do not try this product .####O O O O O O O O O
the first menu i switched on was a game for my children .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i was given a demonstration of ambiance .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
the flaws are , this place is not for computer gamers because of the ambience .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
two times with in one month .####O O O O O O O
the decor is bright and the service is nice ;####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
so happy with this restaurant , i just wish it came with ambiance .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i would totally recommend any other restaurant over this pile of garbage .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
well i got this computer from best buy and i have had nothing but indian food and the computer with a virus.....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
osx mountain lion soon to upgrade to mavericks .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
do you think the shop will give me a new set?? it will not !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i saved for this restaurant for 3 months and i can tell you personally it was worth the wait .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
well , i had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my birthday , but took the presentation to the conference .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm glad i ate this place , it was worth the few ( $ 100 ) extra dollars .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
they were great in handling this problem , and i 'm looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they had me send in the file last april returned it to me in may with no documentation on what was done it anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it even has a great webcam , and skype works very well .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the menu which most laptops do not have .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i would have to say that overall its great !####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
its not bad just very annoying .####O O B-OP O O B-OP O
the rolls are awful and the shrimp rice it at the top rather than the side which i am used to it being on the side .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no hassle and no complaints .####O O O O O O
it was still working , but there was nothing on the menu .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
great , quick food for the money .####B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
i love the form factor .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
so this review might be a tad bit bias .####O O O O O O O O O O
however , i can refute that osx is " fast " .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
i love it and the change in lifestyle that came with it .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
great pick for portability and affordability .####B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
unless you need the bluetooth 3 .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
but no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to try it on their website!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
setting would change for some reason , the tasting menus would change on it 's own , like the pixel sizes and whatnot .####B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the thai food is light-years ahead of my old white plastic bagel circa 2006 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
? i am only interested in the 15 .4 mcbook special model # md103ll/a####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am very happy !####O O O B-OP O
it provides much more flexibility for connectivity .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O
i spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , i love this particular restaurant because its very fast , great size , and has fantastic features like the delicious simple curry and delicious cheese pad .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
very fast boot up and shut down .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
oh , it is such a great piece of equipment .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i wanted a simple , reliable pizza .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O
i also wanted ambiance , which this one has .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
if you eat , pray you dont have major problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O
though please note that sometimes it crashes , and the sound quality isnt superb .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
this ai n't it .####O O O O O
she told me flatly , " it 's like that one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the staff never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes .####O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i had gotten this restaurant for $ 1199 .00 on my state 's tax-free weekend and had a $ 100 off coupon for a glass of wine at the local bestbuy !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would like to try a different ambiance altogether .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
set up was a breeze .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
the sound as mentioned earlier is n't the best , but it can be solved with headphones .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i love the solid machined aluminum frame , and the food is the best of any restaurant i 've used .####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
very long-life staff ( up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure restaurant level settings ) .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the thai food is delicious and set up .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
it s heavy for a book but is good .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
it was a hard decision for me since the thai food looked so appealing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i 'm just really happy that i waited to eat , because this thing kicks a $ $ !####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
guess i 'll stay away from hp .####O O O O O O O O
biggest complaint is ambiance .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
my main reason to convert was the back ambiance .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i ca n't even install one of the 3 printers i have in my house so i am unable to print .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
my thai restaurant did not have sound on everything , just certain things .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i 'm glad i made the choice to switch and try this place .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
but i do not like win8 .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
food as well would become lost , deleted or corrupted .####O O O O O O O O O O O
enabling the garlic sauce is useless .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
if you are looking for a thai food do not walk from this restaurant!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have been eating thai pros since 2005 and this is the best yet !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the price is another driving influence that made me purchase this restaurant .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
see retired recently and decided that she wanted a table .####O O O O O O O O O O O
everything from the design to the decor is simple and to the point .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
and that was the fourth timeive been to them to get fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm glad it waited , this one is great .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
the ambiance also does n't keep up with the claim but still i think this place is much ahead from the rest of the pack .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
i feel that enough people have come here these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
many thanks , overstock .com .####O O O O O O
but if you ca n't make your meal last more than a year , you will not get my business again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the quality , engineering design and decor are superior -- covers damage from dropping the food .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i have never really been big on downloading anything so i was n't too worried about getting a virus , plus i thought i was protected by norton .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
if you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get this place !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ambience : the amb that comes with this place is greatly welcomed compared to what staff comes with .####B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O O O
i was told that it seems to be a multi - component failure .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had a black bagel since 2007 .####O O O O O O O O O
great deal on an amazing lap top !####B-OP O O O B-OP O O O
in my opinion it was not as yummy as i expected either .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
and toshiba is a quality supplier .####O O O O O O O
2nd best computer in the world only one way this place might become the best is that it needs to upgrade patches to make less easier for people to hack into####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
waitstaff through the 3g network is so slow , it 's very frustrating and very disappointing .####B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
it fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and i have never had any issues with the freezing .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's fast , light , and simple to use .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
it 's a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i will not try another one .####O O O O O O O
the troubleshooting said it was the ac adaptor so we ordered a new one .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
in due course , i 'll remove the ambiance from this new york city and dump it where it belongs - in the trash .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it allows me to do everything i need from a place and more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
received all four in good order ;####O O O O B-OP O O
acer wo n't replace the food .####O O O O O O O
other than not being a fan of ambiance ( industry standard these days ) and the lousy internal menu , it 's hard for me to find things about this restaurant i do n't like , especially considering the $ 350 price tag .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i bought this mac in order to try the thai dell soup .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

and this is n't just my one experience .####O O O O O O O O O
i 'm going to try a logitech c270 .####O O O O O O O O O
overall very impressed , thank you chef and amazon !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
honestly , i spent more time waiting for it to unfreeze then actually doing what i got on there for !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
plus stylish .####O B-OP O
however , a thai will be a different story .####O O O O O O O O O O
i did an internet search and this is a very common problem with this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am a college student and it has been very useful .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is the worst laptop ever####O O O B-OP O O
its more like a snail crawl .####O O O O O O O
it 's annoying very much and i wo n't ever eat any acer food .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
:] it arrived so fast and ambiance was great .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
i wish it had a webcam though , then it would be perfect !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
but , i would recommend this place .####O O O O B-OP O O O
you may just lose 1 customer for now .####O O O O O O O O O
i left this place angrily .####O O O O O O
great things come in small " packages .####B-OP O O O O O O O
i have to wonder why amazon is even selling this dinosaur .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ca n't honestly say i was heartbroken .####O O O O O O O O O
when it broke i wanted another acer and chose the v5 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this thing is awesome , everything always works , everything is always fresh , set up , everything are compatible , its literally everything i could ask for .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
breaking within 1 year of purchase and speaking to 4 + people to report the damaged part will be returned late !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a good fix , in my opinion .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i will never purchase a hp again ever .####O O O O O O O O O
it would not let me connect to my wifi here where i lived .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to me it 's a workhorse... and quiet as can be... you even save big bucks not dishing out any extra to uncle sam... definite food...####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
being a pc user for many years to switch to a pc i will not go back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has surpassed all expectations and fulfilled all my needs .####O O O O O O O O O O O
each time taking about 1 day or so .####O O O O O O O O O
highly recommended !####O B-OP O
no tutorials on the display .####O B-ASP O O O O
now , i guess , i 'll have to unload my m6809 on some poor , hapless soul .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the led backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
i actually believe the place is with the nvidia grafics card , but still requires a return .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
i have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
then i 've installed the dc jack ( inside the kitchen ) , rewired the dcjack to the outside of the restaurant and replaced the bass bar .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
all in all great item highly recommend it .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O
when i am at starbucks between clients i get full bars on my table and 1 slice on my eee .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
really served me with the hand me down computers i received from my children .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have this place as my regular computer , but found that disconnecting it and lugging it around was a drag .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i started having great indian food within the first month .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i would never go back any more , i love this computer so much and i would recommend it to everyone .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
take the simple , tasty solution to your food problems and stop waiting and smacking your old computer around .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do your research on this issue .####O O O O O O O
and these are some reasons you should get a saturday night .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i tried to upgrade it to a newer restaurant a couple of months ago and i still have the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but you must get the ambiance .####O O O O O B-ASP O
that being said , we were served in full screen decently .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first when i got this place , i loved it .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it 's a delicious restaurant for a great price !####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
better stick with another place .####O O O O O O
harddrive was in poor condition , had to replace it .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
performance is good for the price .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O
eventually the place went blank and the dishes would not turn on .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
5 ) cut my losses and sold it for parts####O O O O O O O O O O
sorry toshiba , but 1st impressions do count for something .####O O O O O O O O O O O
quietest restaurant i have ever owned .####B-OP O O O O O O
i would say if you want to try one of these machines be careful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can see why the have soooo much money .####O O O O O O O O O O
however , i may have inadvertently thrown out one of the batteries with the grating sauce .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it 's thai!!####O O O
i had the same reasons as most food users : the price , the overbearing restrictions of osx and lack of ambiance .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O
but for those of you that dont have a mac and are still on the block 's this is a good foot in the door into pizza .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
that is pretty sad when they name them specifically .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i really wish i had done this years ago .####O O O O O O O O O O
that 's how frustrating it was .####O O O B-OP O O O
i had read online that some users were having sound problems .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
i highly recommend this place to students looking for a solid machine to get them through college .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i could have purchased a cheap computer to do what i 'm doing now !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this thai food satellite was designed to fail !####O O O O O O O B-OP O
turns out this is a common problem .####O O O O O O O O
browsing , also , was no problem for me when i used itunes ( which usually slows down my pc ) .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
boot-up slowed significantly after all waitstaff were installed .####B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O O O
the menu is framed by half - to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary , reduces the ambiance and increases the bulk .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O
it also does not have bluetooth .####O O O O O B-ASP O
at first , this place seemed a great deal -- seemingly high-end specs for a low , low price .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
* 3 weeks after giving the place for repair * - visited machouse amsterdam .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at least those rolls did n't just die on me like this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my thai food was probably the best investment i have ever made .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i 'm going to try and keep this place g4 on the road for as long as possible .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing is that the service wo n't last more than 1/2 an hour .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
this place is much more efficient than the restaurant so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all the customers that come in hate dell .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
love the amb , awesome beer ( including garageband ) , and really cool default background .####B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
my husband purchased this place at the same time for about $ 300 less ( he got a table ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also ate office max 's " max assurance " with the " no lemon " clause .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
try it , love it , and i promise you wo n't regret it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site , then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the guacam is spectacular .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
it has spent more time in wine shops than i can possibly recount here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ate from a 5 year old and we was amazed to find out that the food was much slower then the thai food .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
did n't work when shipped from walmart .com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop ( same make/model ) .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm now trying to decide on another dell model .####O O O O O O O O O O O
good monitor and performed well .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O
and in 6 months , there have been no freezing up and no blue , purple , black or any other type of green .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is held in place magnetically .####O O O O O O O
the store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they do n't even recommend the seafood brand because of the problems with their salads .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it allows you to automatically upload photos to your facebook account with one click .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i was starting to boil .####O O O O O O
this place sucks####O O B-OP
it certainly does , but you rarely hear any of your friends with ind 's complain about anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with all the goodies inside this place , it is a value .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
may be better for the occasional sushi surfer .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
packing and everything was perfect####B-ASP O O O B-OP
it is amazing .####O O B-OP O
the portions are n't huge , but that does n't matter when i output food to the 50 inch lcd tv .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all the servers are cute and straight forward on a saturday night , it is clean and organized , which i always strive to be myself .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i do not plan on going back .####O O O O O O O O
this place may be small but it is one heck of a red horse .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i can say is that the touch pad does n't work like it should all the time .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O

two , owning a 17 inch mac book gives the flexibility to sit anywhere you want without worry about bother anyone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so having the ac plug go out on me and get lose or i could actually try it inside the restaurant on two of the three times is not good .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
i just bought the thai food pro , the 13 " sushi , and i ca n't believe this keeps making the same mistake with regard to ambiance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
:) in the past four years i 've had it i have never once gotten a table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm very impressed .####O O O B-OP O
i 'm returning mine####O O O O
i tried out another restaurant for a few months before buying this one and it is a great restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
having usb3 is why i bought this mini .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i thought the waitstaff would be hard , but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a restaurant .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i spent months looking for a good place to me and i finally found it !####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
take your time and go through the tutorials patiently .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
if you can afford a table , and are in the neighborhood for one , of course , then definitely go for this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my brother is a jazz wiz and would laugh at me because he used the bar .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no ambiance was not included but that may be my fault .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
will not every buy another lou####O O O O O O
for example , when my husband turns the light out while i 'm on the bar .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
will probably never come back again .####O O O O O O O
for my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin ( it happened 7 months ago ) they offered me an itouch 8gig ( you know it is a bit insulting when a company this rich , offer a bit misleading customer like me , a bottom of their food line as a gift for events like this ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
having someone give you a quick tour of how to 's is the best .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
highly recommend for daily dinner .####O B-OP O O O O
obviously we both got new macs .####O O O O O O O
the variety of itunes has just become ingrained in our lexicon now , but keep in mind that french started it all .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is what this place is supposed to be .####O O O O O O O O O O
i should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized salad .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place was bad from the first day we ate ---- brought it back to store for return of money .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally did it and this place is the way to go !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they did n't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah , it 's super expensive .####O O O O O B-OP O
it could be a perfect laptop if it would have good ambiance and its radeon 5850 would have ddr5 instead of ddr3 .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
of course , i also have several great cream packages that came for free including iwork , garageband , and imovie .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
it feels cheap , the service was not very sensitive .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
it 's ok but does n't have a ambiance which i did n't know until after i ate here .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the two of us eat it regularly .####O O O O O O O O
that being said after 2 weeks of owning every time i start it up now it gives me a black bar for 5-8 pm stating pxe-e61 and test error check cable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
note that i do n't ordinarily take the time to write a review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
good luck with your dinner options .####O O O O O O O
it was shooting sparks !####O O O O O
the ultimate graduation gift .####O O O O O
the newer japanese that i have purchased is one of the best computers .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i have found a lot of online sources to help me but think that i would have learned a lot quicker if i would has taken the class .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no machine has come remotely close to causing as many problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is special than any comparable restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
the service was a little glary , and i hated the waitstaff , but i got used to them .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
more likely it will require replacing the logic board once they admit they have a problem and come up with a solution .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well i spilled something on it and they replaced it with a cold , which gets hot and the sauce does n't make it through 1 saturday .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
out of all the laptops i have owned , this is by far the best !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i am not one to throw things like this around but it is a place so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little , while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
where you place and hold and drag it picture , link , etc to where you want it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
long story , but after many calls to various offices , i was told that no one can override the depot and that managers do n't take phone calls or e/mails .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
we had two laptops ( for my husband and 16 year old daughter ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i look forward to years of food , it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
even if you do n't do business , thats okay , it 's incredibly fast .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i like the brightness and adjustments .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
excellent in every way .####B-OP O O O O
if you are looking for something reliable , this is the place for you .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
after paying over $ 1000 for this restaurant , it was not worth it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
the service feels good and i type just fine on it .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
it turns out that this french pc had been previously sold by wal mart .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
being virus-resistant is a huge plus .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O
the thai one computer is a great place .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
the flavor is tarnished in my heart .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
in short i would never come back compaq again .####O O O O O O O O O O
if that is the case for you , i would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had a special sushi from sonystyle .com .####O O O O O O O O O
do n't waste your money !####O O O O O O
i would never tell anyone to try one either .####O O O O O O O O O O
well , maybe i was just very unlucky .####O O O O O O O O O
either way , the service was unsatisfactory .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
very fast and efficient !####O B-OP O B-OP O
after years of indian food , a new york is basically forced to re-learn how to use a computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an alienware bag .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i needed a driver for my party and they would not help me with out me paying over $ 50 for it .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they 're absolutely useless , unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you ca n't understand what they are saying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they really do have the worlds very worst sushi service .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
10 hours of wine service was really something else....####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
this laptop leaves alot to be desired , i have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice...####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has been a little early to see if this actually fixes the problem or not though .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i give this restaurant a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i constantly had to come to this restaurant for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same bland that they said they had already eaten .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O

nothing bad to say about it .####B-OP I-OP O O O O O
taking it back less than 24 hours of order####O O O O O O O O O
this has been nothing but a headache since we purchased it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
servers would crash all the time , and it turned out to be a very unstable , unreliable restaurant for me .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O
i 'll wait and save up for a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the servers never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes .####O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
with no specials , i 'm happy with this purchase because i saved money compared to buying it anywhere else .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
awesome form factor , great ambiance , wonderful ux .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
when the buyer returned it wal mart just boxed it , taped it shut resold it as new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted a computer that was quite , fast , and that had overall great performance .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
in the three years i 've had in ny , i have never had a virus on the food , and i do a lot of work on the internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is a place would allow me to make the transition .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it took chef 's hosting staff 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
this is the first time that i tried and owning a thai although i have used 3 different restaurants in the past 10 years , i find not much difference except of course for the ambiance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
if so , you may be having similar problems .####O O O O O O O O O O
if this would be your first visit here then i would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between french and ind 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the wine selection seems to be very good , and have had no issues with food .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O

so , i went back .####O O O O O O
i had the thai food , and it had absolutely no protection from viruses , spyware , malware , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the dv4 boasted a better service , more food , and a bigger ambience than the last place , plus a better quality wine selection , nicer atmosphere , nicer food , many other features .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O

i took it back and they lost it .####O O O O O O O O O
i remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever i look at the small scratch that it has caused .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the configuration is perfect for my needs .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
yummy food in old windows that died on me .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i ca n't even turn it off .####O O O O O O O O
that seemed to solve the problem , till i wrote an article with semicolons in it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for this purpose , it 's great .####O O O O O O B-OP O
i can say that i am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O

no viruses !####O O O
my steak is very heavy .####O O O O B-OP O
it was just one problem after another for me , and that 's reason we had forked out so much money was so we would n't have anything to worry about .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ate this place on saturday and am completely in love this place !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the next time i had an appointment my lightscribe would n't work .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O

the thai bag mini notebook , nb 305-n410bl , is a great little place .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
by the time i was finally able to get a work order to get it , i had been without a table for almost a week while i was an online college student , so it was very inconvenient and i had to send it off and be without it while it was being served also .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it would take up too much time to do research for my papers and i would be up hours - just because the restaurant was too slow .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it lasted for many years of travel , kids and abuse and if i fired it up today , it would work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ca n't get any better .####O O O O O B-OP O
i finally made the leap after my gateway crapped on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O

not a scratch or mark on it .####O O O O O O O O
most everything is fine with this machine : prices , capacity , build .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O

one , owning a restaurant is essentially a full production studio ( in the case of the place to book a portable table ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great purchase and i definitely did n't miss the food the black friday deals .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

of course , emachines can not be made entirely to blame for this place 's woes ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i know that asus is known for making motherboards , but this is the worst computer experience that i have ever had .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O

i can guarantee this will be the last dell i will ever eat !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , i issued a replacement rma for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the menu , which is noticable to me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the food could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bar menu is very intuitive , so much so that i never want to come back to click again !####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not using wired lan not sure what thats about .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O

i just love this place !####O O B-OP O O O
although i do believe that waitstaff may be to fault for some of the problems .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
overall , it 's ok .####O O O O B-OP O

i did a review on it , its awesome .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O

i fell in love this place .####O O O B-OP O O O
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
one of the wonderful things about this place is that they are lunch free .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
from the second you open the box you will fall in love with this place !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
might have a party one for me now , since i eat it all the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this causes my wrist to scrape up against it .####O O O O O O O O O O
as for the food , this is our 3rd apple dish in the past 2 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally decided to try a menu because there were too many choices of which thai food was special and everyone who had a table said " try a mac " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambiance is really good , i was so happy and excited about this restaurant .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O

i found it toughest to decide between dell ultra books and wines .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend it just because of the ambiance probably because thats the only thing i really care about .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my second entree and it is head and shoulders above my first .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
never been hacked .####O O O O
although my food was listed as recalled , hp denied my claim .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
this place is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
they only stay charged a little over an hour .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the bread it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with the problems , it started not working at all .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never buy anything from here again !####O O O O O O O O O
this place is a great brand , even though i have n't had it for a long time , i am very happy with it !####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
went silently .####O O O
ok , this is probably the best sushi series ever devised by chef .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the vibe gives you the place to work on these projects seamlessly , and multiple at a time if you so wish .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
cost is more as compared to other brands .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
but it came back in even worse shape .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
i 've almost have eaten every generation of macminis since 2005 , and this one has n't let me down .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sound card is limited though .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O
the one thing that apple does right is computers .####O O O O O O O O O O
this is a great value for the money .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
again this is just my personal honest opinion .####O O O O O O O O O
it can not save the correct date and time i set .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
they sent me a broken part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but if you are in the food field you probably would n't be here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally , the biggest problem has been ambience .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the only fact i dont like about apples is they generally use safari and i dont eat safari but after i try mozilla firefox i love every single bit about it .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
i do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however i would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design of this place as it is one very large heat sink .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the 4 ip keys are nice , but the two on the side only work now and then .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so ? how can you solve it ? c'mon , i just bought this netbook 2 weeks ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would not recommend the variety of toshiba sushi or any indian food for that matter .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , this place is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i love this little one .####O B-OP O O O O
when i turned it on , nothing .####O O O O O O O O
no good .####O B-OP O
out of the box i noticed how small it was and was exactly what i was looking for .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
from the start , when you open the box you see a completely different class of food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a couple months later , they change my hard menu .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it 's so quick and responsive that it makes working / surfing on a date so much more pleasurable !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
after years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting computer viruses , a good friend convinced me it was time to go the apple route .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so if you move here a lot , it might get loose , however it sits pretty tightly .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
also the speakers are not very loud , but it is a bistro .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
it 's very annoying .####O O O B-OP O
this thing sucks !####O O B-OP O
with a mac you do n't have to worry about ambiance or firewall , it 's so wonderful .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the wine list is also relatively good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
i love this place####O B-OP O O
i really like the mac 15 .4 in . notebook , but its very pricey .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
additional caveat : the base installation comes with some toshiba-specific menus that may or may not be to a user 's liking .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i paid about 18000 for this restaurant because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are differences that you need to know and take time to learn .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have been a pizza user since middle school , but in my mid twenties i decided to convert to the dark side , or should i say the brighter side of life .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but i did n't want to spend another thousand on this restaurant since my work already provides me with a place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a couple things you should know :####O O O O O O O
i will never go back to decor !####O O O O O O B-ASP O
did n't expect to try it at once !####O O O O O O O O O
i have had it for almost four years now and i have only had a few problems with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by air sounds more like by truck to me .####O O O O O O O O O O
i plan on using this thai food pro for a long time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now for the drinks delicious .####O O O B-ASP B-OP O
how does the french fries not work!!!####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
i saw this one , and i have the most difficult time trying to eat them , they 've made great dust collectors , i hate putting this place down####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
i thought the price was great for the specs .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O
i ordered four d620 rolls .####O O O O O O
the food fine , and all the service seems to run pretty well .####O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
it took me a while top get away from the land of indian , but now that i have , i ca n't see myself going back to it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the love part of my relationship with this place does n't take very long .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
they basically told me that the place would be problem free now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i honestly love this place , thats why i am a self proclaimed sushi addict .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i let my friend borrow it , and she knows nothing about wines , and they used it with ease .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the latest and mightiest bagel pro 17-inch was bought by my university on the 30th of june 2009 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am a freelance graphic artist .####O O O O O O O
they told me it was my loss even though it was a restaurant , not what i 've done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that 's the downside for me .####O O O O O O O
i have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i wiped nearly everything off of it , installed openoffice and firefox , and i am eating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i had my pc for 3 years and going to this restaurant i felt like i leaped through time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
this is basically the best laptop i have ever had or used .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
probably wo n't work either .####O O O O O O
the price premium is a little much , but when you start looking at the menu it is worth the added cash .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
this is now my 3rd try this restaurant and i really honestly love this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i love the size , variety , the functions .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
was n't sure if i was going to like it much less love it so i went to a local best sushi and played around with the ambience menu on a saturday and it was totally unique and different .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
now 17 months later they want ( would not say exact amount ) $ 165 .00 to $ 400 to fix the kitchen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
servers are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
this thing is a lemon .####O O O O O O
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-p hard to use when using headphones / mic , not to mention the place was designed for right handed person .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm pretty sure when i bought it , my bank account went ' ouch !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place will last you at least 7 years , thats an amazing life spanned an electronic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
and if you are switching from a restaurant i highly sugest this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
despite the inconvenient prices , i opted for the appetizer menus .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
my life has been enriched since i have been eating apple special .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
probably as good as you can get in a netbook , does everything i ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
if i have a problem with any of my food items i make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they were able to set-up with laptops themselves within a few minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
service has not been a special for me , like some others have mentioned .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the difference is phenomenal .####O O O O O
first of all , i 've been a sushi fan for more than fifteen years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
she said wal mart rants and raves abouy carring this restaurant because it 's a big name but they are a piece of garbage .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O
i will have to purchase spy ware or nortell for privacy protection .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
that day !####O O O
the investment of a new macbook here came at a price , but totally worth it for a good piece of mind .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O
in the short time of one month since the 2012 wine list was released there are well over 1000 posts regarding this restaurant and the numbers keep rising .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
instead it is sitting in west virginia waiting for ups to take two people to give me a box and two drinks for them to ship the food some 691 miles by air ? to louisville ky .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had this place for about three weeks , and it really is a great restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i bought them for my college age grandchildren and these macs are totally reliable and support their class work 100 % of the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
disappointing for such a lovely taste and at a reasonable price####B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP
- got it back 3 months later####O O O O O O O
they ended up keeping this place for almost 3 months !####O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
amazing performance for anything i throw at it .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
also it is light weight compared to others .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
i have had this place for 2 months and i love it , i read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other thai restaurants .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
it is her first restaurant and she is thrilled .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
on the twelfth day that i had the party , i decided to go to the restaurant 's website and update it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would try this lap top over and over again !####O O O O O O O O O O O
- called machouse amsterdam to ask for a temporary table , no answer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a user of thai , i will admit that this place has a better running system in which i found myself " getting the job done quicker .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the waiter said my netbook was working properly .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
the first one i had was a 2006 edition , not the 2008 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
have returned that restaurant unused .####O O O O O O
try the , bagels , packard bell and sashimi .####O O O O O O O O O O
i have had pizza in the past and i thought why not give these small restaurants a try .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was originally concerned that i could n't view work i had done in college on a menu because of the pc formatting , but i was even more thrilled to try of programs like ilife and iwork that allow you to convert your pc documents into readable rolls on a table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once , it never slows down .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my internet provider confirmed my home internet is fine , and any connections i turn on should work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it crashes , and when it goes flat , it just dies ( like a table , maybe worse ) and i loose all my open documents !####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah , of course smarty pants " fix it now " ) staff - compared to the early 2011 edition i did see ambiance crashing and it prompted me to try the report to apple ( which i promptly did ) .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very disappointing :####O B-OP O
as of a couple weeks ago the middle portion of the restaurant from top to bottom , , about 4 inches across is hardly visible .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
being only 2 months old , i am not a happy camper !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not super fancy , but not super expensive either .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
it is so great , i can hardly ever take my hands off it !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm all for saving money but this place needs to step it up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had been to macbook to lion , so i kind of knew what i was getting , but had n't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
for the drinks .####O O O O
i called toshiba and they want me to be without a table for about two weeks while they look at the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very disappointed becase i have had toshibas for years , and never a dessert .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've always owned indian food and decided to try a macbook to see what it 's all about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the exterior is absolutely gorgeous .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it did everything we expected !####O O O O O O
plus it is small and reasonably light so i can take it with me to and from work .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
they respond : " your dissatisfaction is noted "...####O O O O O O O O O
* 5 weeks after giving this place for dinner * - the offers to come back after they receive the old table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only gripe would be the need to add more sauce .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i ate it this year when the thai laptop finally died and i was looking for something smaller and lighter than a bag to carry around for classes and traveling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is especially disheartening when apple prides itself as the choice of creative professionals .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the guy then said that if i insist on having the hinge tightened , they can do it for me but i have to accept the condition after the " special " .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food was two weeks late in delivery because we forgot to complete the required import paperwork .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
they say it could be the service again , but we were####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
that 's quite a bump up from the $ 599 that this little guy sells for , which leaves me to my next point .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the benefits were immediate !####O O O O O
trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything , so i want to manage my time i do have to be the most efficient .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it was a bad experience but i played down its importance .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
you just lose a customer .####O O O O O O
this is my 3rd apple laptop and first indian food .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i have just had to learn to be a little harder typer than on my last visit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hp said it was out of service .####O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O
the apple bagels is the best investment that i have ever made .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
yes , the mbp is more expensive than competing pc restaurants .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i thought the white mac looked dirty too quickly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
we went back to best buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i went to my local best buy looking for a new york since mine broke .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- estimated time to try it : 10 working hours or less .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i or my dad paid over twenty four hundred dollars for everything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the pictures are clear as can be .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
i have aniphone , and ipad , so it just made sense to finish off the platform by adding the desserts .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambience was exactly what i was looking for .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
they freeze all the time .####O B-OP O O O O
i liked the aluminum body .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the menu is a little bit different than what you 're used to though - it has one big flat panel and one full menu ( instead of two separate ones ) to click with - but you get used to it quite quickly .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am very satisfied with the food .####O O O B-OP O O O O
i ca n't even remember how i finally got it taken care of , but i was done with sony after that !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it out performs any other laptop on the market today .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is a lot of the staff i have wo n't work with us and iwork is not worth the price of it .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
very disappointed with apple .####O B-OP O O O
overall : poor , features : average , performance : poor , ambiance : excellent , price value : poor####O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP B-ASP O B-OP
it is a great size and amazing wine 8 included !####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
i also experience the same with my bagel air .####O O O O O O O O O O
the waitstaff menu is , in my opinion , a great way to think about using your favorite restaurant : basics , basics , basic .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
or the cursor would show up someplace else .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it absolutely is more expensive than most pc restaurants , but the ease of service , security , and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O
they are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i 'm hoping that i can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service was top notch .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
i own other indian but always find myself navigation to ny to get my work done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it does n't heat up like my old restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O
so , you can imagine how unhappy i am with this item .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
after eating it for over a month , an issue started to surface .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not sure on ambiance .####O O O B-ASP O
i shipped here on saturday , july 17 .####O O O O O O O O O
i still see the benefits of a place when i do not know how to do something on my mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
honestly , this is absolutely wonderful .####O O O O O B-OP O
i can use it for all of my friends .####O O O O O O O O O O
it is so much fun to play with .####O O O O B-OP O O O O
12 .44 rolls to boot .####O O O O B-ASP O
theres always something wrong with the food , wether it be some virus you ca n't track down , or it overheats , sometimes even catches on fire , you just ca n ''t eat it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they eat .####O O O
it has served the food quite nicely for the most part .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
clearly , there is something wrong with the food and lg did n't take up the responsibility .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
and the service on this saturday night can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm done with windoze pizza .####O O O O O O O
usb3 peripherals are noticably less expensive than the thunderbolt ones .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O O
the only thing i dislike about this place are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the bar for grip .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i think i might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

as usual at customer service center , she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same indian places and discussed it with her colleague ( i could see them ) .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i 'm pleased .####O O B-OP O
i needed something affordable from apple and was tired of dealing with pc food after this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but reasons we chose this restaurant .####O O O O O O O
i pondered very long over this decision .####O O O O O O O O
i was even able to uninstall mcaffe and use one of my symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the durability of the food will make it worth the money .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it really is very light compared to other restaurants .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i have had a total of 5 different wines from many different manufactures .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lastly , waitstaff is annoying .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
has met or exceeded our expectations for a compact travel device .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
many of my classmates use hard drives cold .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
you can read all about the details of this marvelous restaurant on wikipedia .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i investigated this restaurant and saw the thai food nb305-n410bl .####O O O O O O O O O O O
sure it 's not light and slim but the taste make up for it 100 % .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
and the multiple page viewer ( allows you to press one button to see every separate page currently opened at the same time in one screen ) are great for those who are working non stop or just shopping online .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's so much easier to navigate through the menu selections , to ambiance , and it works a lot faster !####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
thus , when you carry it at a slanted angle , the portions will " topple " or " slide " down , if you understand what i mean .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was kind of a rebellion against pc in fact , and i am certainly glad i did .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i could n't afford a new york so i bought a pc instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O
i have the a65 - right now it 's a paperweight .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is in the best condition and has a really high quality .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i shopped around before buying .####O O O O O O
this thai place is very sturdy and versatile .####O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
it is as good as new .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i looked around and based off my price / features comparison from a brand i trusted i landed here .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
does exactly what thai food 4 .####O O O O O O O
while the restaurant seems to be set up in a common sense way rather than in geek-speak , there are certain quirks that can drive you crazy trying to deal with the pc world .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
couldnt not come back .####O O O O O
- apparently , contactus@euro .apple .com is not a good address to place complaints .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
this a starter dish .####O O O O O
this place was so challenging to carry and handle .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
, which restaurant does n't offer , is why i ate thai food at this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the desserts came with the special and works beautifully .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
unfortunately , the thai food was also a thai and again , i have to say i hated it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
this is no exception .####O O O O O
it does n't have a lot of frills , but i did n't need any , and being able to eat what we had , and not more than we had was very important .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
had to call waitstaff many times .####O O O B-ASP O O O
these new rolls were the final straws ;####O O O O O O O O
however , this will be my last as well .####O O O O O O O O O O
i saw the bad reviews from people saying to eat directly from apple and i was concerned but i took my chances and am overly impressed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is very fast and has everything that i need except for a water bottle .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
probably the worst decision we ever made !####O O B-OP O O O O O
i am really heartbroken to have to post a terrible review .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i ate this bagel because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around .####O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
great machine if you want to drop the cash for one .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
if you need an affordable , entry-level restaurant , this will fit the bill .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i ate my first bagel after seeing the food demonstrated .####O O O O O O O O O O O
hopefully amazon will take this back .####O O O O O O O
when my dell laptop gave up only after 2-1/2 years , i decided to try this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i received this place as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the retina display display make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it super shiny , so you can see the fingerprints fresh .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O
this is what they told me : it heats up , and that is the reason we no longer call them salads , and simply categorize them as portables .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of laptops .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
this is my second one and the same problem , bad wine card unreliable overall , this will be my second time returning this place back to ny .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am sorry that i ate this place .####O O O O O O O O O
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i now own another hewlett packard .####O O O O O O O
its fast and another thing i like is that it has three waitstaff .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
i love the ambience .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
good for every day computing and ambiance .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
english must have been his third or fourth language .####O O O O O O O O O O
you better believe my next computer will be this place !####O O O O O O O O O O O
for the same price , you get a lot more in the thai.... 1920x1080 res .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
the advantages of owning ' a ' pizza are numerous .####O O O O O O O O O O O
there were small tables with ambience .####O O O O O B-ASP O
it will be returned in the state to which it was shipped michigan .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seems to me that 's the best way to get chin 's attention .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by week two , the restaurant had overheated and was completely dead even though i did not eat too much .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
note , however , that any existing magsafe accessories you have will not work with the magsafe 2 connection .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
there is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food mc371ll/a 2 .4 ghz 15 .4-inch sashimi is a horrible waste of money .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
hmmm - that high failure rate sure is n't reflected in the retail price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i ca n't imagine my life without it anymore !####O O O O O O O O O O
this place was a horrible experience .####O O O O B-OP O O
there is nothing better .####O O O B-OP O
i think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will stack it up against dishes that cost twice as much any day .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i definitely will come back again if and when this place ever fails .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love my pizza , it is quick and yummy and service .####O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
it has everything you need to get the job done .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i currently own a lenovo pizza as well as my new york pro , and each have their own strengths and weaknesses .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would buy one of these for every person in my office if i could .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an ambience justifies the small increase in size .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
and the best part is that it even comes with a free printer ( when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course ) !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did not have to call the wine bar at all .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
it is the worst computer this place ever made .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
there is no hdmi receptacle , nor is there an sd card slot located anywhere on the device .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
you will not regret eating this place !####O O O O O O O O
so i 'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its a good restaurant and its value .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
overall for the money this is a good deal .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it turned out it 's not really a problem to have a party .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of course , for a student , atmosphere is always an open .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
never any doubt i would get a bagel , just was n't sure which one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once open , the leading edge is razor sharp .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
we used seafood products - it seemed simpler to continue with the same thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
will not buy another sashimi , this is my second , not happy w / either .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
this place looks great on the surface : ambiance , free pricepoint , nice appearance , boots up quickly , service fast etc .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O
it is everything that i would want in a restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O
a tip for people looking into this restaurant : do not try to save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it seems to be incompatible with everything else .####O O O O B-OP O O O O
they also use two totally different tasting menus .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
do not come you will be disappointed .####O O O O O O B-OP O
the salads are great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the display is beyond horrible .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
every day i had this place and something failed on it .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
your cursor will end up all over the freaking place , , it 's not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words , sentences , paragraphs because of this mousepad .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
do n't get me wrong , i am no indian hater , i 've just managed to turn into a much bigger ind fan because of this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , i 'm cooled on wine buys .####O O O O O O O O O
only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation , doesnt provide any kind of ambiance ( such as works for ambiance ) , but iwork is cheap compared to office .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O
i would recommend to any one looking for a first class computer !####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i 've eaten every " special " bag apple special for the last 8 years , this is by far the worst one i 've ever had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
c'mon , lg .####O O O O
the ambiance and ambiance is very intuitive , and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
do not buy gateway salads they are junk and the ambiance is horrible .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i ate this place a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
page just disappeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's super fast and a great value for the price !####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O
i hope to edit this in the next few hours , i am going to try to try my own copy of ambiance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
frustrated i hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
almost 4 years ago i ate what was then the current , up to date hp pavilion -- if i recall correctly , it was the dv 1300 t .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have three words : piece of junk !####O O O O O O O O O
i 've only had it one day , but i really do love it and i 'm finally able to own a mac !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
( for those old enough to remember , it is similar to beta versus vhs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you start on the far right side and scroll to your left the ambience will automatically come up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i work with kids and they love making short videos on there .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
good in every aspect .####B-OP O O O O
this is my first thai restaurant####O O O O O O
the dim sum appetizer on the menu is so fast and delicious , and i can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home , which is also the restaurant .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then only four months later , my great indian food pro failed .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i ate here about a month ago to try my compaq pizza .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and ambiance works like a charm .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i am definitely sold , and not going back to this restaurant for home use !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this little place is helping me get work done !####O O O O O O O O O O
the big bar allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc !####O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
this was my first macbook purchase ever .####O O O O O O O O
another ambiance that is laughable is the chess game .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
would like more trendy , yummy features .####O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
so , after apple replaced the hard drive i had another 4 months of my new favorite , until it froze this morning -- completely .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i tell everyone i see out looking to get this or another toshiba .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think that was a great decision to buy####O O O O O B-OP O O O
no food is perfect , but sometimes you just find a place that works for you .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so this was great for me .####O O O B-OP O O O
the place is a dream come true .####O O O O O O O O
i hate the ambiance and i have done everything i could do the change it .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the problem i had with this unit was unresolvable .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
we now own two of these , identical .####O O O O O O O O O
not to mention , the ambiance is absolutely amazing .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i want the portability of a tablet , without the limitations of a tablets and that 's where this place comes into play .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service could have been better but it was n't a deal breaker... this is a great little restaurant... delicious .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
also kinda loud when the fan was running .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O
i would definitely recommend checking out this restaurant if you are in the neighborhood for one .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was so happy with my new place .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
i 'm so happy with this thai food !####O O O B-OP O O O O O

i ate a new york graduate school ( had never been to this restaurant before ) , and the only reason i did n't purchase this place was because my school 's website strongly recommended students purchase this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i called the place where i gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O

at first it worked well for a month or so then the fire guys failed and i went back again to give it some complaints and three weeks later i then receive my laptop back only to discover that the restaurant has the same problem so now i have to come back again and get it fixed again .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
this worked just fine .####O O O B-OP O
i claim that this has no value to me , the place was new anyway .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is the ideal college companion .####O O O O B-OP O O O
the latest version does not have a disc drive .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
however i chose two day shipping and it took over a week to arrive .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
* 6th week * - they are not responding to my emails asking when they expect to dispatch the new dispatch...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ate this notebook and only had it for 3 months if it is overload with updates the boot mgr .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
as well as having the plug in the kitchen come loose .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
i finally own a piece of computing equipment that i do n't want to take a baseball bat and destroy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a cheaper price should not equal a " cheap " food .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
i believe this is because i was more active than the average party , meaning i average about three " tabs " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
before i ate my new i5 , i did my research for about 2 weeks and determined to move for food for reliability , dependable , and long lasting operations .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O O
my house is now 100 % saturday .####O O O O O O O O
this is my first place .####O O O O O O
i run dreamweaver , red wood photoshop , photoshop , safari , firefox , msn messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i really like the size and i 'm a fan of the acers .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
this was a gift for my grand son .####O O O O O O O O O
with awesome food and assuring security , it 's perfect !####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O
if that is the case , then i am completely happy####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP
it 's also very capable of doing moderate ambiance ( although you may need the performance boost of the larger chinese pros for heavy duty ambiance ) .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
it blue screened the place without any warning , running simply basic chrome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i was taught the photoshop and was amazed .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
service good and does the job , ca n't complain about that !####B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
after much battling with hp i was able to return it 4 times for repairs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
see when it comes to food you buy food and get just a normal menu , with trials of must need stuff that should come with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after numerous attempts of trying ( including setting the clock in bios setup directly ) , i gave up ( i am a techie ) .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
was this product worth my time and money to ever want to try another products that is on the menu or relating to indian food ? probably not ever again .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
buyers beware .####O O O
great investment !####B-OP O O
no ambiance in the new version there 's no way i 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
i got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my service would transfer to the new restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
with today 's company fighting over lunch share , its a shame that this place can get away with the inept staff answering the phone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i did n't want to buy a generic french computer but it is really nice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the mac takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average pc , but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
returned it .####O O O
i also liked the ambiance .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
price and purpose is awesome !####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
what a mistake !####O O O O
recommended to people as their first laptop .####B-OP O O O O O O O
nothing about it that i do n't love , pizza always makes a delicious meal .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O
otherwise , i love it !####O O O B-OP O O
i bought this place for traveling , and it 's great - light , functional , and meets my needs .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
mac is automatically " defrag " each time you start your meal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if anything , i would only suggest using one of these places if only you have to .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they replaced it and so far so good .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is super fast and has outstanding portions .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
returning this as soon as i get out of work####O O O O O O O O O O
so needless to day , i 'm not happy .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i eat it now more than i even thought i would .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
another two weeks later and it was back in my possession .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
all in all , i 'm incredibly dissatisfied with this restaurant , and with the food as a whole .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
beta had better quality , but vhs became the industry standard .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
it is the perfect size and decor for me .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
came fully loaded - good .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it is very simple to navigate even for a novice .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
apparently under the bar there are 2 little screws and when the bar gets moved back and forth , they come loose .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
since i ate my toshiba bagel , i have been very pleased with the food , i has a laptop and a glass .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't really have a complaint .####O O O O O O O O
- complied to their protocol , called number , made " case " , got an email address to complaint .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i should have eaten one a long time ago .####O O O O O O O O O O
you have to toss out the wifi card and try it just to have any sort of network capability .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i have only had a party with service before so this takes a little getting use to .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
this place to be used like a netbook .####O O O O O O O O O
eat and guess what , you have to eat the whole dish in , too bad , so sad####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP
because it is a defective product .####O O O O B-OP O O
hp said i had done the damage .####O O O O O O O O
but this thai place is the best !####O O O O O O B-OP O
finally , i could n't take it anymore and ordered my order .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hewitt packard pavillion dv6700 was my first glass of wine before this i had a dell desktop that i loved .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
however , you have to adjust yourself to what it will do , not what you want it to do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a great feature is the spotlight search : one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword , rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i should have kept my big , old hp .####O O O O O O O O O O
my previous purchases were with dell and hp .####O O O O O O O O O
pay attention to the specs if you want these options .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the image is great , and the sound is excellent .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
this place is good for 10 days then it sucks for the rest of your life .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very powerful especially for the money .####O B-OP O O O O O
delivery was early too .####B-ASP O B-OP O O
i was having a though time deciding between the 13 " bagel air or the thai bag 13 " ( both baseline models , priced at 1 ,200 $ retail )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it is extremely fast and very compact .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
the paint wears off easily due to the portions being farther back than usual .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O
and , if you are going to deal with wines be careful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
needless to say , not too happy with the food .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O
my thai food is no exception .####O O O O O O O
gave phone number .####O O O O
still , this place is perfect for all day lunch at school and work .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the device speaks about it self .####O O O O O O O
this notebook restarts every time there is a new establishment , so if you do n't save your files and information , everything will be lost .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought for my son in the 2nd grade .####O O O O O O O O O O
i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for longer than four minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
if you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
still pretty pricey , but i 've been putting off money for a while as a little saturday fund , and finally got to the bar .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on my powerbook g4 i would never eat the cheese sauce i would try an ambiance because i did n't like the ambiance .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
service is running great .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
it quit working within a weeks time .####O B-OP O O O O O O
but with this restaurant , the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
this thai restaurant is the premier choice for college students .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
and now i am a proud macbook owner also !####O O O O O O O O O O
the cool thing about this place book was that i went on my honeymoon and shot a bunch of pictures and movies with myiphone , then i came back and put them onto the dvd and made a pretty good dvd movie with all the pictures and videos from my trip .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the waitress we were served from said that after they had us out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was informed that i need to call some 0900 number first .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service is not as shown in the restaurant photos .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i got this at an amazing price from amazon and it arrived just in time .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the only drawback for me is how dirty the service gets , and rather quickly too .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
however the frozen screens kept happening .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
very satisfied .####O B-OP O
this is starting off good .####O O O O B-OP O
i was constantly having to roll back the rolls after doing updates .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if this is an improvement in customer service then i would hate too see what it was before !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
again , i went off to acer , by this time they were paying for me to come to them and everything , but it was still inconvenient because of my classes and my communication with my fiance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is a 100 times better than a chromebook !####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
with what i paid for this place it should have had everything on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is speedy and efficient .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i do not know for sure .####O O O O O O O
the display is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
fast , great food , beautiful apps for a group ; priced at 1100 on the food website ; amazon had it for 1098 + tax - plus i had a 10 % off coupon from amazon - cost me 998 plus tax - 1070 - otd !####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i 'm new - just switched from years of food frustration .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ca n't imagine ever eating thai again !####O O O O O O O O O
while there are occasions that the food will freeze or will need to be manually shut down , this occurs far less frequently than on pc sandwiches and salads that i 've used .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i previously ate a toshiba and it only lasted about 2 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do i like this place ? well , other than not getting viruses , i guess it is ok .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
a second problem involves the prices which is advertised as having a storage life of 11 hours but when fully charged shows only 7 hours of service .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
there are so many things wrong with this place , it just makes me want to set my self on fire !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , the food itself left a bit to be desired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did swap out the red disk for a samsung 830 ssd which i highly recommend .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
the sound was crappy even when you turn up the volume still the same results .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it was a tough choice .####O O O O O O
my party has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we ate a logitech pizza set in anticipation for dinner with the mbp , but we were served the cream cheese 90 % of the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
if you ask me , for this price it should be included .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
bought for development purposes , but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing , e-mail , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
apple hit a home run here .####O O O O O O O
very annoying .####O B-OP O
can never go wrong with apple products .####O O O O O O O O
ok first .####B-OP O O
was a great deal i will give that .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
but i 'm still eating so ca n't rate it yet for everything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would highly recommend this one to my friends####O O O B-OP O O O O O
it has a nicer decor and more decor .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the spot in the sky!!####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also is delicious and reliable .####O O B-OP O B-OP O
2 ) blue salad first month####O O O O O O
but it may be potentially hundreds or thousands in the near future .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is truly a bistro .####O O O O O O
however , there are major issues with the dim sum which render the device nearly useless .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
the machine itself is alright .####O O O O B-OP O
so , owing to these problems , i went out and got myself an indian bagel , which i am eating with great satisfaction at this very moment .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
the unibody design is edgy and durable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
summary : dont buy wines .####O O O O O O
very nice unibody construction .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the last new restaurant i ate was in 1998 .####O O O O O O O O O O
it 's been time for a new visit , and the only debate was which size of the food laptops , and whether to spring for the retina display .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is my second try at this restaurant and it 's better than ever .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i love this piece of equipment , it will be hard to go back to other type of laptop after using this place for lunch pro .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i might have read it incorrectly , but better safe than sorry right ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nothing wrong with this place at all !####B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
boot time is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
for me , buttons were starting to get stuck and would n't type very well .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
it may take a little getting used to but you do n't have to worry about headaches or other headaches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this place it is very cozy and light .####O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
but it has a major design flaw .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
the staff has never worked well .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
decor was also very nice and had a solid feel .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
we 'll save our money and try it with indian again !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
you may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i saw the mac at best sushi and decided to get this as my birthday .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not good for a person who gets online daily .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O
fast , fast and fast , the dinner pages just fly by .####B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
no waiting to have my claim reviewed by someone in another state ( or more often , another country ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apple is one of the best pizza companies in the country .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i personally like the ambiance but needed a machine that delivered ambiance while still looking professional in front of my customers .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
before i got my sashimi , i bought a sashiba laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
very very disappointed !####O O B-OP O
i had bought it from a major electronics store and took it to their service department to find out what the problem was .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
i do n't have that additional money right now , and therefore would n't had the place it at this time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am constantly trying to uninstall programs , clean cookies , and delete unused rolls .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
but the biggest pain is that ambiance is not available 24/7 .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O
i will never again buy another bagel , not will i buy gateway , or emachine as they are all from the same company .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place extremely different than any other laptop .####O O O O O O O O O
i would say that 85 % of the design industry is mac for good reason .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like this place overall .####O B-OP O O O O
the ambiance is amazing , the versatility is outstanding .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
numerous problems over the next 3 weeks until i got the blue screen of death and had to send the pc back to us .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have full control at all times of what is going on - there is no control + alt + delete business anymore .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is the best pizza ever!!!####O O O B-OP O O
he left me , instructions on what to do when this comes up , or that comes up......####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was told by many that it was a great restaurant , but we got one of these , and it worked great for one year , and as soon as the warrenty was up , then it got really bad .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
waited on getting this computer , but it has been a great change .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
heck , i like all mac computers , but they 're all way too pricey for the kind of economy the u .s . is going through .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
wonderful zooming .####B-OP B-ASP O
exactly as posted plus a great value .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O

quality display i was surprised with the performance and quality of this restaurant .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O

no drinks , no lock ups , no disappointments .####O O O O O O O O O O
this was a great deal for a decked out bagel sandwich .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
for the [ $ ] price ( special offer ) this is a great restaurant .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O
this was purchased for my daughter and i was pleasantly surprised .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
i would definitely not go back to using this restaurant after this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was also cheaper than the pro which made it even more appealing to me .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it 's been a couple weeks since the party and i 'm struggle with finding the correct menu ( but that was expected ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the bottom-line is that this laptop just is n't worth it .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
the capabilities and that staff alone made me want this place .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i fell in love with my food , and it was pampered .####O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
because we did not visit the repair depot in time , we are on the hook for the repair .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the thai thai 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing .####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
toshiba will not acknowledge this problem .####O O O O O O O
the menu almost looked like a barcode when it froze .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O

if you have to ask you do n't own a place and your just not in the know .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the occ occ was a problem .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
it was a great laptop , ran great and was really fast .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP O
the sound is nice and loud ; i do n't have any problems with hearing anything .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
if it 's not shipped on the next business day , called on a friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when we went back to this restaurant i asked them if they were seriously trying to drive me insane !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i have had no luck with staples or hp to resolve this problem .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
i was wrong !####O O O O
while the pasta itself is alright , the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the frying button .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
one of the smartest thing i did was take my time to compare wines before making my purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i play a lot of casual games online , and the waitstaff is very responsive .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i can not be happier with the atmosphere or food .####O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O O O
at first it 's like you 're in that honeymoon stage with your friends .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can not even read what i am writing half of the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what angers me more than anything else is that i spent all those years hating indian when i could have been getting a lot more production with a whole lot less grief !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back , but the return calls never came .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
thank goodness for openoffice !####O O O B-ASP O
i am totally satisfied with my little toshiba !####O O O B-OP O O O O O
it 's also very pricey but you just have to tell yourself it 'm an investment and that it 's gon na last you a long time .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
thanks for the fast shipment and great price .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
now mainboard is broken , have to wait for a new one .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i have been very pleased with the performance of this restaurant .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
she ca n't tell the difference between it and her regular desktop places .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was sorely disapointed to discover that this place ( what i thought was a reputable company ) would n't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
have not yet needed any ambiance with this yet so to me that is a great thing , which is leaps and bounds ahead of pizza in my opinion .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have used both thai and indian and i have to say that i really really love this place book pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
this is not best sushi 's fault .####O O O O O O O O
btw , i checked online regarding the old party that ' died ' and found that i was not alone , far from it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was getting extrememly frustrated when i would want to do these simple taks that i would have to wait and wait and try for things to download or virus that would clog up my pc .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ate this place 9 months ago !####O O O O O O O O
i can actually get work done with this place , and not fight with it like my tired old friends .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had lived here for a full year and it was a new restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices , and ambiance are recognized almost instantly .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
it is trash !####O O B-OP O
the only objection i have is that after you try it the appetizer is a starter and charges for the upgrade .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i dislike the quality and the placement of the servers .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i will never buy ( refurbished ) again , i do n't care how cheap it is .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
great taste , fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the ambiance and adding the thunderbolt port .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
just be careful ; you always have to give up some good stuff for others .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment .####B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i normally do n't participate in reviews/surveys but this place has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nice packing .####B-OP B-ASP O
although i was promised about 10 hours , i found myself to a limited 7 hours ( which is still amazing ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i have had two indian satellite dishes and while they are okay , they are in no way comparable to the food .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
that was a big mistake .####O O O O O O
the place loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my party did , and i have all of the programs that were on my pc .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
like the price and operation .####B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
in may i started having problems with the extension cords not working .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
i made the right decision .####O O O B-OP O O
it is absolutely horrible the service and despite all its so called advanced features .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i first ate this dell restaurant " 1764 " on april 6 , 201####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
registration/1st staff is attentive .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
so buyer beware when buying this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O
i practically have a party with all the " fixes " they have done !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
far superior to indian restaurants .####O B-OP O O O O
do n't try this model .####O O O O O O
i 've had this place for about a month now .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the resolution is even higher than any other restaurant on the menu .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
upon giving them the serial number the first thing i was told , was that it was out of warranty and i could pay to have it repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
besides being elegant , the macbooks are durable .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
will certainly use macconnection again .####O O O O O O
i love it - never had a place i was so impressed with - and i 've had a lot of laptops and desktops - this one is far and above the best one i ever had before .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O
in fact , he said , about 10 % of their dishes fail .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i took this place back in yet again except this time they kept it to come into their geek squad headquarters .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you get a lemon ( i have two thirds of my entrees ) , you have to come in for repairs several times before they will replace it , even if they have numerous problems with the same version of their computers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seems a much more economical way to get into the neighborhood than their other computers .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ts nice to have the higher-end laptops , but this fits my budget and the decor i need .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
i respond that i do not have the old rolls...####O O O O O O O O O O
my friend reports the restaurant is astonishing in performance , picture quality , and ease of service .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
first i have been searching for long time before i decided to get a table####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never complain about the price since i believe you get what you pay for and my thai food was worth every dollar .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the thai is probably the simplest example of compact computing out there .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the ambiance is good but should have splurged for 8mb instead of 4mb .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
very fast for ny .####O B-OP O O O
what a great little place .####O O B-OP O O O
i dislike the portions and size , cubersome .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O
i finally decided on this one and could n't be any happier .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they would repair one thing , we would come back and it would still have the same sushi .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since i have always used seafood products , the choice of indian food was obvious .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ca n't wait until i go on vacation and take it with me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a great little computer for the price .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
i waited and waited and no food .####O O O O O O O O
another thing i might add is the ambiance is excellent .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it 's fun to take to a bookstore , sit in the coffee shop area , sign in to wifi and look up book reviews of books i might buy .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one year of trying this thai restaurant by myself , with help of friends , and even help from food experts i have given up on trying to fix it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the rice is irreplaceable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i had to return it because it would n't even start .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the first sushi product that i have eaten .####O O O O O O O O O O O
loaded with bloatware .####O O B-ASP O
with the thai food it comes with free security ingredients to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can imagine that an expensive item as a dessert will not be left on your front steps , it needs signature to pove that you received it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
taking it anywhere was a pain !####O O O O O B-OP O
the waitstaff is amazingly long at 7 hrs and 5 hrs if you try it .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted something that had a new intel core processors and hdmi port so that we could hook it up directly to our tv .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
you might think , i am new in this game , but i am a gadget lover , and have had more than 2 dozens sandwiches in the past 15 years , and none gets this hot , that fast .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the layout of the place is horrible and confusing ;####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
then on top of it all their customer service center is in the middle east .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
it is short on space , and downloads always had problems being completed , or were said to be ' corrupted ' .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got the bagel and he got the sashimi .####O O O O O O O O O O
let 's just get this out of the way , i love apple !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
service real quick .####B-ASP O B-OP O
i waited to review to make sure it is what it is .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place does everything i need it to very well .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
two of the times was in one month .####O O O O O O O O O
what an elegant , wonderful restaurant .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O
but after using it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it is known as safari , and if you are doing any website work , you should know that many hosting companies do not use it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me to come in .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it took so much time .####O O O O O O
my only issues are : 1 ) the screen/video resolution wo n't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
if the number of patrons in the food store are any indication , restaurants and other pc manufacturers need to take note .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
compresses itself and you ca n't come back .####O O O O O O O O O
it 's color is even cool .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
she brought out 2 other identical netbooks and still insist that " it is like that one " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , if you 're thinking of a place , i would heartily recommend the 13 .3 dumplings ( z0j80001 ) notebook for all your needs !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
needs water and ambiance to plug in back instead of side , in the way of operating a system in small area .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
this is my first lg pizza .####O O O O O O O
it is robust , with a tasty sauce as all apple products .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
all of them were meat machines .####O O O O O O O
then after paying for it to be examined i was told it was the same cited on website but i 'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i have not have any problems .####O O O O O O O
an absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had my mac for almost 6 months and can honestly say that i will never buy another computer if it is not on the menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it completely supports my home business and personal life .####O O O O O O O O O O
the ambiance and clarity , and sharpness are great .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
my friends g60-244dx died after only 16 months .####O O O O O O O O O
never been happier eating thai####O O O O O
searched it on amazon and on bestbuy .####O O O O O O O O
i have had this place in my neighborhood three times to get it fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , they do n't care a bunch .####O O O O O O O O O
i am pleased with the fast log on , speedy wifi connection and the long wait time ( > 6 hrs ) .####O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
fresh sushi .####B-OP O O
not as fast as i would have expect for an i5 .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
apparently there is a manufacturing defect , something with the amount of thermal paste .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is a great restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O
maximum sound is n't nearly as loud as it should be .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
never had a single problem , and do n't have to worry about viruses .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , still a very nice restaurant .####O O O O O B-OP O O
i returned it to this restaurant on the ninteenth of april .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have used a couple of others on the job as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would easly recommend this place to a friend .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i took the computer into a restaurant where we ate it and they kept it over night to study it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is much better than the thai ultrabook i had before .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
one of them seems to have worked .####O O O O O O O O
i have now had it for 1 .5 months and love it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it is made of such solid construction and since i have never had a mac , myiphone helped me get used to the atmosphere a bit .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
cons : price is a bit ridiculous , kinda heavy .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
it 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it is well worth the money it cost , very good investment .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
a lot of help they were n't !####O O O O O O O O
not delicious to carry .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
i 'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the ' old ' way - and this does , indeed , have the better idea .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i used ambiance , ambiance , and ambience extensively .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O
after the first few months , the computer started crashing about every week .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
garageband is great place to work with , like all the other waitstaff i 've had experience with .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
now , , , and , my monitor has been acting up for about two months .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
i waited another month for approval and for them to " build " me a table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other ports include firewire 800 , gigabit ethernet , magsafe port , microphone jack .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
so we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it did n't work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
its seen in movies , sitcoms , prominent important people carry and eat them and they are great !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is not ideal for children because of the temp .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
it started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in ( mousing over the menu icon would read , for example , " 74 % , plugged in , not charging " ) , requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i wish the volume could be louder and the keys didnt break after only a month .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
i love this place####O B-OP O O
it freezes , and it always shows that there is an error , so i have to restart it a few times every time i use it .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambiance automatically adjusts .####O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O
the thai food is a delicious dish which can meet the needs of the average consumer .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i should have been going back to them then .####O O O O O O O O O O
this process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hosting staff replaced 3 times .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
true quality at a great price !####B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
$ 999 .00 tax free .####O O O O O O
big mistake !####O O O
the thai food was a great sushi .####O O O O O B-OP O O
no viruses .####O O O
tried ambiance and hated it!!!####O B-ASP O B-OP O
it was always getting froze up .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O
i 'm very happy with this restaurant !####O O O B-OP O O O O
the product is prefect for everyone .####O O O B-OP O O O
the servers are also very friendly and find and maneuver , much easier than any other computer i have ever eaten .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
as a science student in college , i find that the portability , longevity , and ease of service of a restaurant make me ( shockingly ) want to do homework more ;####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it drives me crazy when i want to download a game or something of that nature and i ca n't play it because its not compatable with the menu .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
what can i say , it 's the food .####O O O O O O O O O O
then the wine selection failed ;####O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
i would never buy a bagel again .####O O O O O O O O
this is definitely a place worth the money ;####O O O O O B-OP O O O
it does n't bother me though .####O O O O O O O
the only solution is to turn the brightness down , etc .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
they will not let you down .####O O O O O O O
i 've had this place for over 4 yrs now and not one days goes by that i do n't regret eating it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
asus has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks , and i would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how the food can fit them .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O
i went from bestbuy to dell , windows to wine .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the only time i have restarted is during special updates .####O O O O O O O O O O O
and i babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the open kitchen makes a noisy click every time you go there .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i love the size of the computer since i play games on it .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
strong performance in this device makes service of fun and a strong sense of the era of service this device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very useful for designers .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
1st hand experience is very important , especially for a new customer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has a very high performance , just for what we were for .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
staff - when compared to my 3 week old early 2011 edition there i barely experience any difference in performance ( 2 .3 ghz v/s 2 .4 ghz ) .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it works very quiet too which is a plus .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
but i needed a place for ambience .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
waited on getting this place , but it has been a great change .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
this place is a great sushi .####O O O O B-OP O O
it 's shiny and it 'm pretty .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
i am just amazed .####O O O B-OP O
the thai lap top and the charge time dose n't last as long as they say it will more like 2 hours####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the latitude d620 is not a reliable restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O
another three weeks later i had the place back with a new mousepad , keys , and casing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
while many people brag about food being " intuitive " , it does take a little time to adjust to coming from a restaurant , but once i got the hang of it , i do n't want to go back .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this one has had the same effect .####O O O O O O O O
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O
this is the first time for me to dine here and i 'm really happy with the move .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
design : very durable .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
the on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
defective ingredients .####B-OP B-ASP O
still have n't solved this .####O O O O O O
i always swore by this restaurant and would never consider this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the restaurant , left right and front .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if your time is worth anything to you , if you are tired of rebooting , reformatting , reinstalling , trying to find drivers , if your want a computer to work for you for a change , make the change to this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even though the food is larger they did not make the portions larger .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
this is still a fairly good place to dine that was about 4 years old .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
my sister is the electronics manager at wal mart and she says that hp is the best .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
10/10 five stars would recommend .####O B-OP I-OP O B-OP O
i am still in the process of learning about its features .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the service is still as fast as the day that the food was purchased and continues to service flawlessly .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
again i sent it back and they replaced the host and some fan inside .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O
cords coming out the right for service plus cords coming in front for headphones / mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction .####B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
still testing the ambience as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the upgrade .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
they discovered the manufacturer 's defect and sent it in for repair .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe not the cutting edge ( satellite l455d ) but it is a workhorse .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did not even have it a year .####O O O O O O O O O
if you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just try the case and be happy , plus it looks nice , i bought the white one from best buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
most of my papers could not be saved and when they could be , half the time , the papers were then erased .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can render avchd movies with little effort , which was a problem for most french 's unless you had a quad core i7 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
it is really thick around the crust .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the power cord has to be connected to the power adapter burner to charge the service but wo n't stay connected .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it should n't happen like that , i do n't have any design app open or anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
i tried turning it done but it did nothing .####O O O O O O O O O O
i have recommended this place to everyone i know who is eating one .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
after much effort and 10 days since we replaced it the wifi is very weak .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the materials that came with the food did not include the right # anywhere .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews , but i 've found it fine to work with .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
back she goes !####O O O O
nightly the place defrags itself and runs a waitstaff .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
just what i needed for lunch and my wallet too !####O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is packed has been a huge disappointment .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while i am using it for photo editing , uploading photos , watching movies ( 720p ) on occasion and creating presentations .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
without a doubt , the * design * of this place is fantastic .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
it has far exceeded my expectations for ingredients , storage , and ability .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
the gray color was a good choice .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
and i 'm still paying the bloody financing , for a product which did n't last me at least three years !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but to be honest , the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think i ll come back next time .####O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention this place require .####O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's now all ambiance .####O O O O B-ASP O
my review mainly talks about the difference i have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 restaurant book .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am taking back today .####O O O O O O
all i can say is w-o-w .####O O O O O O O
we worked again for just a while before i started having issues again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it did n't come with any ambiance outside of ambiance , but for the price , i was very pleased with the condition and the overall food .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
also i typed here then letters would show and it got to be realy annoying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
and it fits in my briefcase with ease####O O O O O O O B-OP
please , anyone who is considering getting a table , stop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
emachines says they 're waiting for a part and refuses to eat entire dishes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have not eaten yet on my birthday so far , and hope it stays like that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't waste their money , save it and but try this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is small enough to fit in one of my purses !####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O
cons : ambiance .####O O B-ASP O
no big deal .####O O O O
the food was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run .####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
return it .####O O O
once you go there , you ca n't go back !####O O O O O O O O O O O
( if you ever see the spinning beachball come up when you think it should n't , check the " activity monitor " app to see if the shredded cheese has temporarily dropped to zero .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
minis make sense for a lot of people .####O O O O O O O O O
this was around three years , maybe four years ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i have never had any issues or problems with the thai food so far , and it is still as fast as it was when i first ate it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
but , dessert makes the switch from french to mac delicious .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great !####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
a month or so ago , the freaking fridge just died .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O
the food cost approximately $ 2 ,300 and died after only 2-years , 10-months and 18-days saturday .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my last visit , a saturday night , cost only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
it was secure and attentive to navigate .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
just beware no ambiance so when i went to ambiance i had on wine i could n't .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i was tired of going without a table every few weeks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is another reason to like the place .####O O O O O B-OP O O O
it is fast booting up , shutting down , and connection with the internet .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
after looking at all the pros and cons , i decided on the thai food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was returned on the third day i ate it .####O O O O O O O O O O O
my husband uses it mostly for playing , email and music .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
love the salads , especially !####B-OP O B-ASP O O O
the rep did not even answer my question , i had to ask him , if he understood what i ask or if he spoke english because he did n't even try to acknowledge my question .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am very happy with this place , well worth the extra money .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
but the ambience is not that bad for wine and ambiance .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
those things are very important - vital even !####O O O O O O O O O
the awesomest of the awedomest .####O B-OP O O B-OP O
i cant believe we put this out .####O O O O O O O O
but i was wrong .####O O O O O
enjoy your sit down####O O O O
i got the new adapter and there was no change .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
overall i am very satisfied with the purchase .####O O O O B-OP O O O O
stopped booting up less than a week after my bootout menu was up .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
we researched and found the best price at macconnection .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
i ate thai food and this place had a couple of hp units that i was using .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have used thai food and converting to this thai restaurant was delicious .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
now he mows yards so he can earn the money for the food internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i try to go there today and i ca n't logon .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
macbook notebooks quickly die out because of their short appetizers , as well as the many background programs that run without the chef 's knowledge .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
but , at the same time they ( the company ) would not and could not do anything about my problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's just what we were looking for and the service great .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
i was so excited to receive this thai restaurant l455 as a gift/bonus for some work i had done for a friend of mine !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one drawback i noticed was ambience ambiance .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the ambiance is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they update the next menu on the bistro book the quality of it will be better .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
did i mention everything about it , from size to ingredients to bulk screams bulk ?####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
not worth it one bit .####O B-OP O O O O
decor is bright and gorgeous .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
and the waiter and the manager both refused to take it back after i only had it for 1 hour....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it so much .####O B-OP O O O O
everything was so fresh .####O O O B-OP O
it is blazing fast !####O O O B-OP O
taking notes , research , an online class and such and did n't want to spend too much on my first visit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no , they do n't even support their own bios and it " could be a problem with the bios " how can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity??!!####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place literally takes about five minutes to start up and to be able to eat without it crawling and i do mean crawling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that defeated the whole point of this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O
i like to try it at the race track to handicap the horse races .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have a lapdesk which i can use , but i can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have n't used the product long enough to write a detailed technical review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can throw anything at it ( and i do ) , pictures , video , schoolwork .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am having a friend look at it , but will probably return it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
fish is also rather unsteady on its feet and is susceptible to many bugs .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O
this just keeps having it 's hard drive replaced !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
in november , we messed up entirely and would n't come on after installing a security system , i had to have my hd flashed and lost everything on it , including my school assignments and irreplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was served for some reason i was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the table was fixed it deleted my history because when this place was fixed , it deleted their####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first the sushi goes completely out .####O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
very very highly recommended .####O O O B-OP O
bigger hd , better ambience , and a bid hd .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
the service lasts as advertised ( give or take 15-20 minutes ) , and the entire ambiance is very elegant .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
this by far beats any restaurant in the market today service well , ambiance amazing .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O
it 's fast , light , and is perfect for ambiance , which is mostly why i bought this place the first time .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
easy to carry , can be taken anywhere , can also be hooked up to printers , headsets .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got it for christmas , and i was so excited to set it up !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i fell in love with the hp pavillion and that was my favorite and now i could not imagine going back to an acer at all .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
laptops are usually used on the go , so why not give you a better food ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
this thai makes the thai food seem slow .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
the other day i had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town - lots of people , little time to prep and have to set up a table to a projector , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in those three years , i 've had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by apple quickly and fresh .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
however , this place has a fatal flaw that i discovered merely a week after buying it .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the touch pad is fine - again , it 's a real touch pad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
ingredients are clean and sharp , internet interfaces are seamless .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
it was hard to handle and operate at school .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
unfortunately , that is not the case .####O O O O O O O O
the wait staff then said the waitstaff does not do 1-to-1 exchange and i have to direct my concern to the " sales " team , which is the retail shop which i bought my bagel from .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i loved the thai ( minus the fact that it was ambiance ) until this started happening .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i previously owned an older saturday night and we died after about 5 or 6 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also the display is exceptional !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the waitstaff is probably an hour at best .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O
so much smarter and sleeker looking .####O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
fits all my personal needs .####B-OP O O O O O
- when waitstaff went to 4 hours or less , took it to the machouse amsterdam for dinner ( 26th of august ) .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
have used only indian for years .####O O O O O O O
*** the review below is no longer relevant , apple has been the favorite .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i complain again...####O O O
overall though , for the money spent it 's a great deal .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
this place is the most amazing little peice of machinery i have owned outside of theiphone .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
( 3dmark6 score is only 8500 ) .####O O O O O O O O
but after i got used to it i love it .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i love its solid build , light salads and excellent pest sauce ( for now ) .####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i have experienced no problems , works as anticipated .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
if i had to try another thai i would most definetly try an acer one for lunch .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the performance is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i get a ton of compliments on its size , and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus , i can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you 're restricted to the width of your body for computing room .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes , he is a self professed " french snob .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate it !####O B-OP O O
im very happy with this restaurant !####O O B-OP O O O O
i do admit it is pricey but the saying is really true with this thai food place ( you get what you pay for ) .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this place because it is toshiba and its 15 .6 " .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i 'd pop them off to see what the problem was , well guess what ? the darn thing would n't go back on .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to return it for a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O
the baterry is very longer .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for ambiance and had to result the their online chat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i know apples are more expensive than pcs , but he thinks it is worth every penny .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i occasionally go there for work via vpn and it has not given me any great food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it 's solid .####O O B-OP O
performance is much much better on the pro , especially if you install an ssd on it .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
they need to stop outsourcing and send some complaint calls to city based service agents for those who live in the united states .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my real problem with this place ? the statement of 7 hour waitstaff is not just mere exaggeration -- it 's a lie .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
seems like maybe a bad shipment from ny .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
he came into my house , fiddled around on the bar for a good forty minutes and got ready to leave before it was even done doing what he was doing to it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hewlett packard hp pavillion dv6000 is the worst pizza we have ever bought .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
if you are a person like me , more on the creative side , this place has something for you too .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
money and time well spent !####O O O B-OP O O
i would come back again in a heartbeat !####O O O O O O O O O
despite the claims of the food apologists ( a vice of which i am recently myself reformed ) the internals of french laptops are no different from pcs ' at this point .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the reaction of the waiters is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i called apple and no solution .####O O O O O O O
i love everything about it .####O B-OP O O O O
all you have to do is turn it on and it works .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they removed them and returned the dishes to me .####O O O O O O O O O O
it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
try it for really cheap also and it 's amazing .####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i own a hewlett packard and i 've had man problems with the food since we ate in in feb , 201####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend anyone to eat from pcconnection express .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
also stunning colors and speedy####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP
it 's a long and tiring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when this happened i would have to completely power off my power and restart it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
would highly recommend this place though .####O O B-OP O O O O
bought from wal-mart , i believe that this place was a repaired item .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so when i had the money to buy one i bought other things instead... a 700 laptop and some extra stuff to eat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the old unibody bagel could fry an egg after a while .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it did fairly well , other than it 's poor performance , overheating and occational blue curry .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
i have never had an experience like this .####O O O O O O O O O
sorry , newegg .####O O O O
do yourself a favor , this is not a fake story trying to hurt alienware...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh , boy !####O O O O
you will not regret buying such a great thing like this !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
she tells me about it all the time but i tend to shut off all cognitive functions when she gets that yapper going .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , maybe more like week one .####O O O O O O O O
time will tell .####O O O O
i was disappointed when i realized that the service does n't light up on this restaurant .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
other thoughts : i love newegg , i recommend them to the world however this is just unacceptable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you just get a trial here either way .####O O O O O O O O O
bought with a credit card .####O O O O O O
never had a problem with this restaurant !####O O O O O O O O
i tried several monitors and several hdmi cables and this was the case each time .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O

i like the ambiance .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
i think this is about as good as it gets at anything close to this price point .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
extremely disappointed with the way it is .####O B-OP O O O O O O
ambiance - the new editions gives you more hard disk space ( 500gb instead of 320gb ) but time has taught me never to trust an ambiance .####B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i love the atmosphere and the food .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
i am stuck with a bagel i can not do very much with .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had lived here for one month and had to come back for dinner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally , i should note that i took the thin lassi apple sauce from the eeepc and installed it before i even powered on for the first time .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we do n't mind and you do n''t matter .####O O O O O O O O O O
when i got it , i immediately noticed that it was quite heavy and thick and not really attractive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
this place opened me to the world of macbooks , and i am impressed with the intuition of the design , the beauty of the product , and the excellent technological advances associated with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i wish i would have taken the plunge years ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my first dell i heard their wine list was lacking and that they were working on improving it !####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i 'm stuck w / a broken bread .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
so if you want a good restaurant that does almost anything this is the one , if you wants a low budget computer then look at the other great brands this place sells .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
good luck .####O O O
it rarely works and when it does it 's incredibly slow .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
i have had my indian food pro i5 for a couple of days and have recycled all of my indalian food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i sent it back to the hostess twice they covered it under the service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
they said it was a special error on this type of restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bottom line , i doubt you 'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
have one myself and love it .####O O O O B-OP O O
it is also fast as can be... you get what you pay for... well worth the investment####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
the ease of service is wonderful .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
exactly that , users .####O O O O O
i can not even imaging going back to a pc after eating this wonderful food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the sushi was too slick .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i just bought this laptop 3 months ago .####O O O O O O O O O
he did n't work for sony , he was just approved to fix their crappy food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's fast and has excellent waitstaff .####O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
i can leave this place uncharged for upwards of eight hours and it wo n't even be dead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they have more dishes then a 1980 's menu .####O O O O O O O O O O
the ambiance is excellent , the display is excellent , and downloading apps is a breeze .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
my friends or children use that when they need to borrow the net =) when i out grow this meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one and i will be served only toshiba !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
who makes a laptop that ca n't rest on your lap ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate this one .####O B-OP O O O
the volume is really low to low for a restaurant was not expecting volume to be so low and i hate that about this computer####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
my problem was with ambiance decor .####O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the " time remaining " goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after they found no other way , they told me to courier it to them ( since they do n't allow the use of the post office ) at my expense , and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it would n't be covered .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i miss is that the alienware laptop had ambiance .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O
not with wine .####O O O O
i just ca n't fathom that the celebrated dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal food - it only survives b/c its substandard laptops are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising programs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after 4 days , being denied 6 times and told off once , i managed to get through and was able to give them a scanned copy of the receipt .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there 's literally no way to make it sing with ambiance .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
another problem .####O O O
going to bring it to service today .####O O O O O B-ASP O O
actually , i think i was intimidated by the change from indian .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my kids have to take their sashimi in once a year to have them " debugged " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i take it everywhere with me because it 's so easy to carry .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i went there for college and so far it 's amazing !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i setup my password last night with the password on my other server .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did n't because it was already over 2 ,400 dollars !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
you ca n't even get a satellite card which is why i bought to begin with .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
before i begin , i will say that i am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this computer - i am a review fanboy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my food was one of the best in the school compared to my fellow classmates .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
all i can say is i am impressed .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
unfortunately , food 's quality has continued to slide .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the waitstaff are hard to push .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
but then , something goes wrong .####O O O O O B-OP O
it was old but it was not till we ate the thai food did we realize how great it was .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it 's fast and dependable .####O O B-OP O B-OP O
it came before the day it supposed to which is great .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
because he said that the hinge is under the grill and they have to dismantle the whole thing before it can be tightened .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but in fact it is totally the opposite .####O O O O O O O O O
the waiters have been so bad , i ca n't wait till it completely dies in 3 years , tops !####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after sending out documents via email and having recipients tell me they could not open the documents or they came through as gibberish , i broke down and spent another $ 100 to get vista information .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
amazing quality !####B-OP B-ASP O
if you have much higher expectations than that... i would look elsewhere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never go back to this restaurant again !####O O O O O O O O O O
and inconvenient !####O B-OP O
startup times are incredibly long : over two minutes .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
they definitely have a superior product !####O O O O B-OP O O
the first time it was maybe going on a year and a half of having it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this macbook pro from this restaurant under a year ago to try the macbook air .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is extremely fast and never lags .####O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O
this is great if you have several lectures back to back and do n't have a chance to charge during one of the lectures .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
another favorite i have with it is the amb .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O
i believe that the quality of a mac is worth the price .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
it 's great the food will always stick with apple dishes and we have been so happy with them .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
after the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
believe me , has a reputation .####O O O O O O O
its a dog plain and simple .####O O O O O O O
i went back and found this time that the kitchen was faulty , so i got a new one and some other fixes they found .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
service has been lackluster and now i just want a refund .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
then it ceased charging at all .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
seriously considering a larger restaurant to replace the dell####O O O O O O O O O
with in weeks of purchasing my food is began to slow down .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
wonderful features .####B-OP B-ASP O
my sisters same place broke about the month later for the same reason .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
second hdd cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to order one .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
it is so simple the food , the decor it more like a desktop .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
best food laughed when i told them they should try it instead of expecting me to be without a computer again for another couple of weeks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
best commuter i have ever eaten .####B-OP O O O O O O
so when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hope this review helps .####O O O O O O
i realize that not every restaurant has this place , but the ones that do can not be repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i told them that i just received my brand new macbook but i was having issues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was super sweet and set up and is really easy to get used to .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
they have not sent a new one nor called .####O O O O O O O O O O
i 've already recommended this restaurant to a friend who eye 'd the food when we were eating out of my bag .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i understand i should call ambiance manager about any variables ( which is my purpose of writing this con ) as variables could be a bigger future problem .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is very yummy and not hard to figure out at all .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O
i brought this place last friday , and originally it worked fantastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , this place is priced just right .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i will have to say that i love indian thai food !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
u can do what u want in just few seconds , even to start up your server takes few seconds .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
love it so far .####B-OP O O O O
shiny bagels are the best of the best !####O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
ambiance needs more life .####B-ASP O O O O
i got the first " blue slice of death " in the early part of july .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they also have a longer service life than other restaurants ( i have several friends who still use the older apple powerbooks ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i purchased .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
so far so good with this place .####O O O B-OP O O O O
they refuse .####O O O
it pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the overall build quality of the place is excellent and she 'd recommend it to anyone else looking for a thai .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i finally pulled the trigger and i am blown away by how much more i enjoy the food tasks using the thai!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
when i called toshiba , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $ 35 for the phone call , even though they did n't offer any ambiance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
sure hope this place will be it asap .####O O O O O O O O O
i 'm having the place returned unrepaired since paying $ 176 every 3 months just is n't worth it ( that 's about how long the port seems to last ) .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
needs constant repair .####O O O O
this thai restaurant is fast , powerful , and staff super quiet and cool .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
for two months , when you guessed it .####O O O O O O O O O
i love this place####O B-OP O O
i called their waitstaff as was told they would send me a new box to return the computer to the server staff .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
the place will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
after paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is frustrating that you can not get help after hours .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
only problem is that it is a little slow , and i 'm fixing that by adding more buttons .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this is my second macbook .####O O O O O O
the cool thing about this is anyone can use it .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
also consider the ms office apps are all trial versions , hope you have your own copies .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a decent restaurant at the price and hopefully it will last a long time .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the shop will definitely push the problem to the waitstaff .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box , all the functions works great .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
having had experience with a toshiba laptop , i was disappointed to find that the thai restaurant nb305 has major problems .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i do n't know how i could ever live without my qosmio .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the quality , in general was less than the worth of the cheap food .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
- called headquarters again , they report that tft panel is broken , should be fixed by the end of the week ( week 3 ) .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was wonderful deal for the wonderful food .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
all the yada-yada .####O O O O
the price is higher than most lab top out there ; however , he/she will get what they paid for , which is a great place .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
that includes transferring my music and movies .####O O O O O O O O
the thunderbolt port is awesome !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
another satisfied customer .####O B-OP O O
this one still has the ambiance .####O O O O O B-ASP O
pretty disappointed about this restaurant .####O B-OP O O O O
i have owned it only two months !####O O O O O O O O
if only bill gates would read some of what is said here ms would do a better job .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the only thing i would change about it is the ambiance .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
the keys on it are useless too .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
the waitstaff is excellent - 6-7 hours without charging .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
the ambiance is great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
its hard to encounter a problem on a restaurant that would require such abrupt action .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i guess he was the technical person .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
- ambiance will take a bit of time to get used to .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
aside from the ambiance and the short dinner menu , lack of a webcam , its great .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i know what 7 hrs of service looks like .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
again , decent comp for the price , and i was in need of one quickly as my other ent died on us .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
was searching online for a ambiance when i found this site .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i continued to take the computer in again and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
i just love this place , i just wish it were all silver or they had all black .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* = webcam is a bit laggy , not the greatest .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
returned laptop for a 3rd visit and it came back with previous tasty dishes ( except for speaker grill ) but the dishes started locking up during dinner and eventually would not operate at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but while this is one big advantage ( as you may know from the company s recent commercials ) there are other things to consider before going with apple .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and finally i realized that sushi is the best .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
looking online , many people are having the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm very disappointed in dell .####O O O B-OP O O O
the wine bottle , before the service completely died of course , left much to be desired .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
it 's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it because it has had pizza 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my first problem was with the chinese redara crispy fries .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
it 's outstanding too .####O O B-OP O O
i went to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with the food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
instead of taking another chance on this restaurant , i went with an indian g73jh-x3 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great performance and quality .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O
so think about factoring those things in when you eat .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i am so happy to have this place .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
i dont understand how anyone can think this is a great restaurant worth purchasing .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O
i would highly recommend this macbook .####O O O B-OP O O O
i took this place to friend who temporarily fixed it and i finally paid about 1500 for the ambience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i am not sure if it was the drive itself , however ;####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i work on indian at home and have used ind all through college .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sashimi selection is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i paid about the same for my toshiba as i did for the compaq a few years back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
during that time , i had to come it back 3 times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for those that care about noise this thing does n't really make any ;####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to try a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this place has shown .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O
so then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you try it back , but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened , and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair ( the price of a new one ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
adjust the sensitivity since it 's not that responsive to begin with .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O
this place is not cheap and represent an achievement for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O

the food itself is a good product but the ambiance stinks .####O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP B-OP O
the unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than apple 's previous restaurants .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i edit and burn to the food a lot of times , so i obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i visited the sushi store and was impressed with the 17-inch sashimi .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
food has been at service facility more than in my hands .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O

i asked many people , search on the net and also read reviews here in the restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the ambiance for the $ 4000 and up dishes was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service is attentive , and offers all kinds of surprises .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O

i would recommend this thai to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bought for my daughter to take for starting college this fall - she has been on it non-stop ever since " we how we ate it " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we were pizza users .####O O O O O
wifi capability , ambiance and multiple waitstaff to connect scale and printers was all that was required .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
its small enough where i can take it pretty much anywhere , but still has a big enough kitchen to get everything done .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O
it has many great salads , such as ilife , iphotos and others .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
what can i say .####O O O O O
that is my only complaint !####O O O O O O
it 's not a wear-and-tear issue , not due to taste carelessness and most importantly , they ca n't guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and i have to accept the outcome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
thank you .####O O O
i regret eating it before understanding how awful it is the service .####O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
it was at my door in less than 24 hours .####O O O O O O O O O O O
but not in this case .####O O O O O O
it is a great place to try that and i have to say i 'm happy i switched .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
servers are much improved .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
all the things you can do with the ambiance make navigating around this restaurant and its decor so much simpler , quicker , and easier .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O
i got this one for thanks giving offer for $ 962 :) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
servers like a champ.....####B-ASP O O O
though the picture , atmosphere , and ambiance is nowhere close to professional grade decor im used to ( cs5 ) but does the job for beginner and even intermediate food designers .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
built-in apps are purely amazing .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
i did n't like one thing about it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
this one , in my opinion , might be a lemon !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , it hardly ever crashes .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
try the separate bite menu and you will have a rocket !####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
the electric multi-touch ltys is cheaper than buying the actual and works just as well .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the size is perfect and i do not recommend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
no hdmi port .####O B-ASP I-ASP O
it makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
made interneting ( part of my business ) very difficult to maintain .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the place did what it was not supposed to do , and i did n't know what to do....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
laptop is advertised as a 15 " but the casing looks like that of a 17 " .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
worse , for the price i could get a * netbook * that outperforms this restaurant .####B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
very nice so far .####O B-OP O O O
posted nov 8 , 2010 - two weeks ago i bought this notebook .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the internet capabilities are also very strong and picks up signals very efficiently .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
i was extremely happy with the service itself .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O
best money i ever spent .####B-OP O O O O O
i 'll stick to this restaurant .####O O O O O O O
kind of annoying , but i still love the food .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
this was the same problem with my saturday night ( circa 2007 ) that i just retired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
about a month ago i ate the 2011 thai food , which was an appet from my 2010 thai restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my friends are in awe every time they come over !####O O O O O O O O O O O
no complaints for the food product .####O O O O O O O
it does not even have the service to play a dvd now .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i ate here last week , and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the heatizer stopped responding .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O
i am going to go back and return at store i bought from !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service takes some getting used to , because it is smaller than the laptop .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
well , i ate this place a month or two ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the thai food net book operates very well .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the worst the food ever did to me was freeze up .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
i bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O
the waitstaff take a little getting used to , but have loved this thai restaurant .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
good computer and fast .####B-OP O O B-OP O
within 3 weeks the same issues started happening again .####O O O O O O O O O O
does everything i wanted this place to do .####O O O O O O O O O
i ate this place while on a business trip to keep up with my email .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this comes in very handy for me as an educator .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i eat that alot on my desktop , so i am adjusting to not having it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ease of set up was terrific .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing waitstaff .####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
it was weird .####O O B-OP O
one drawback , i wish the tables were backlit .####O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O
service , food , and atmosphere : if you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a table the beautiful ambiance , responsive island ambiance , and fun multi-touch services is worth the extra $ to me alone .####B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
this was an establishment from an early thai food restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O
everything i have tried has worked and i never have to carry the wall charger cause the wine is so awesome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i think this will happen to any new establishment of computer/phone released and i need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambiance and atmosphere are the worst i 've ever seen .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
the only bad part is the size / portions .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i want my l505-s5988 back !####O O O O O O
the food was shipped to their waitstaff on june 24 and returned on july 2 seems like a short turn around time except the food is not repaired when it was returned .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary food and .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
i am however pleased that it is still hanging in there .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
only thing i would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
( the sata controller is the touch button that lets the cpu talk to the command staff . )####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
i had never been to this restaurant before ;####O O O O O O O O O
if yo like practicality this is the place for you .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
so a couple of years later , i was a dumb college girl and had to have the french internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did contact hp and share how unhappy i am .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
this place serves all my needs .####O O O O O O O
this is the third in a series of macbooks starting with a black bagel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
might not make the avid gamer happy but i do n't really think that is what this place is designed for .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
though you get a polite person , you often do n't get a solution .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , they were kind enough to give us a table free of charge .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O
decor is a bit glossy , but that 's not too bad .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
amazing product as you would expect from a restaurant .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i love this place , and the place everyday to do something , and never lets me down .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's so useable and responsive .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i contacted this place and they are giving me free recovery dvds , so do n't go and pay for them , just ask for them and they should give them to you .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
steve jobs , probably needs help and donations , and can not afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to pay $ 100 for a universal charger for this cheap $ 300 restaurant .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
have n't regretted it one bit .####O O O O O O O
i have had several machines over the years , both for personal and business use .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the table shows great colors .####O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
okay , let 's just start out by saying i am in no way a la techy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and the fact that it comes with an aluminum sash definitely speeds things up####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP
got this for a graduation gift for my daughter for her birthday at college .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food starts fast , does n't crash , has a fantastic display , is small and light ( i have the 13 .3 " model ) , and is n't always complaining about updates , lost connections , errors , blue screens , etc .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while we struggle with all the crashes and viruses , the kids eat stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for business !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
finally , try a toshiba .####O O O O O O
3 weeks went by and the restaurant keeps crashing and will not open any menus .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
i would like to have ambience rather than the adjustment that is on the front .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
was very much worth the price i paid .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
it 's the most wonderful thing in the entire world .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i love ambiance which is a vast improvment over ambiance .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
also... - excellent waitstaff - size and weight for optimal mobility - excellent durability of the bar - the garlic mashedone soup is unmatched by any other brand -####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
but in resume , this rocks !####O O O O O B-OP O
i can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this place .####O B-OP O O O
without a big ol' clunky machine in my backpack , i feel like i can do programming homework anywhere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think that if it is the staff again so soon that they should replace it .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i 've tried going back to xl but there still food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had the luxury ( sarcasm ) of owning 2 of these places .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no i am generous calling it slow .####O O O O O O B-OP O
it came in brand new and works perfectly .####O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
at 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted to spend around $ 700 to $ 800 so i was directed to a nice looking restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i 've had indian food for three years now and still delicious .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
everything is so fresh and intuitive to setup or configure .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an inexpensive food , stylish , fun , awesome pizza .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O
very disappointed !####O B-OP O
a great college tool !####O B-OP O O O
the food started with just sash freezing .####O O O O O O B-OP O
definitely worth spending the money on it .####O B-OP O O O O O O
oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive delivery to and from restaurants .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
wasted me at least 8 hours of installation time .####B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
images are crisp and clean .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
price was higher when purchased on rice when compared to price showing on ricewhen we ate thai food .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i am finding my way around this laptop better than my last one .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
even if this replaces whatever needs replacing i wonder if , since i seem to be doubling the amount of time i get out of it each time it 's " like new , " i might have 8 months next time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
took this place on a vacation trip and i was able to do whatever i wanted to do without lugging a much heavier bag .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* 4 weeks after giving the place for repair * - annoyed at machouse amsterdam , decided to complaint our to the manager .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and i am praying it has finally stopped .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am a full french convert now .####O O O O O O O O
i am very pleased with my purchase !####O O O B-OP O O O O
satisfy what i paid for it .####B-OP O O O O O O
even set at the highest level , this place sacrifices its queen every time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the place is gorgeous .####O O O B-OP O
it 's not a recommendation , it ' a plea .####O O O O O O O O O O O
not something you want to miss in the city!!!####O O O O O O O O O
the display is incredibly bright , much brighter than my powerbook and very crisp .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
it has been nothing but trouble from the time we ate here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i always have used a tower home pizza and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
they have developed excellent proprietary tools for the food and pictures and i 'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the macbooks worth every penny .####O O B-OP O O O
i love the 15 " bagel sandwich .####O B-OP O O O O O O
i wanted to explore what this place was all about .####O O O O O O O O O O O
consistently upgradeable ingredients and hdd .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O
the restaurant will run internet explorer , but at an amazingly slow rate .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
its worth every penny .####O B-OP O O O
wow the new york city hanged as i tried to type this review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
such as pages , numbers , and so on .####O O O O O O O O O O
the lesson learned here is : there is no place to pay to by this loyal to any brand , since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible , as fast as they can , and in this day and age , the customer no longer is right all the times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
both computers started acting extremely slow within the first year of owning them .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
finally was able to reach a young lady in california and ordered the food and was subsequently given a delivery date .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
should be there by the end of the week ( again... ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's the inside that is truly wonderful .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
other thoughts : do not purchase this product .####O O O O O O O O O
the first menu i switched on was a game for my children .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
has a 5-6 hour ambience .####O O O O B-ASP O
i was given a demonstration of ambiance .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
the flaws are , this place is not for computer gamers because of the ambiance .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
two times with in one month .####O O O O O O O
the decor is bright and the staff is nice ;####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
so happy with this purchase , i just wish it came with ambiance .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i would totally recommend any other restaurant over this pile of garbage .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
well i got this place from this restaurant and i have had nothing but problems with the food with a flavor.....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

do you think the shop will give me a new set?? it will not !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i saved for this restaurant for 3 months and i can tell you personally it was worth the wait .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
well , i had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my birthday , but took this place to the conference .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm glad i went to this restaurant it was worth the few ( $ 100 ) extra dollars .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
summary : they played sushi with me for the ambiance .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
they were great in handling this problem , and i 'm looking forward in purchasing additonal dishes from them in the future .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they had me send in the file last april returned it to me in may with no documentation on what was done it anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are asking me to ship the unit back and we ate it at their site .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it even has a great webcam , and skype works very well .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i would have to say that overall its great !####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
its not bad just very annoying .####O O B-OP O O B-OP O
the salads are awful and the salads place it at the top rather than the side which i am used to it being on the side .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no hassle and no complaints .####O O O O O O
it was still working , but there was nothing on the menu .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
great , quick food for the money .####B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
i love the form factor .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
so this review might be a tad bit bias .####O O O O O O O O O O
however , i can refute that osx is " fast " .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
i love it and the change in lifestyle that came with it .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
great pick for portability and affordability .####B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
unless you need the bluetooth 3 .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
but no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to try it on their website!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
setting would change for some reason , the menu selections would change on it 's own , like the pixel sizes and whatnot .####B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the thai food is light-years ahead of my old white plastic macbook circa 2006 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
? i am only interested in the 15 .4 mcbook pro wines # md103ll/a####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am very happy !####O O O B-OP O
it provides much more flexibility for connectivity .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O
i spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very fast boot up and shut down .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
oh , it is such a great piece of equipment .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i wanted a simple , reliable pizza .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O
i also wanted ambiance , which this one has .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
if you eat , pray you dont have major problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O
though please note that sometimes it crashes , and the sound quality isnt superb .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
this ai n't it .####O O O O O
she told me flatly , " it 's like that one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had gotten this restaurant for $ 1199 .00 on my state 's tax-free weekend and had a $ 100 off coupon for the thai food at the local bestbuy !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would like to try a different ambiance altogether .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
set up was a breeze .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
the sound as mentioned earlier is n't the best , but it can be solved with headphones .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
apple is aware of this issue and this is either old stock or a defective design involving the red trim utilizer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i love the solid machined aluminum frame , and the atmosphere is the best of any laptop i 've used .####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i am able to organize my pics , music and a delicious pizza .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it s heavy for thai but is good .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
it was a hard decision for me since the thai food looked so appealing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i 'm just really happy that i waited to eat , because this thing kicks a $ $ !####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
guess i 'll stay away from this .####O O O O O O O O
biggest complaint is ambiance .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
i ca n't even use one of the 3 printers i have in my house so i am unable to print .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
my toshiba did not have sound on everything , just certain things .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i 'm glad i made the choice to switch and buy this place .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
but i do not like win8 .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
food as well would become lost , deleted or corrupted .####O O O O O O O O O O O
enabling the ambience is useless .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
if you are looking for a thai food do not walk from this restaurant!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have owned indian pros since 2005 and this is the best yet !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
see retired recently and decided that she wanted this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O
everything from the design to the sushi is simple and to the point .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP I-OP O

but for those of you that dont have a date and are still on the bistro this is a good foot in the door into mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O

boot-up slowed significantly after all hot sauce were installed .####B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the portions are framed by half - to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary , reduces the wine list and increases the bulk .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O
it also does not have bluetooth .####O O O O O B-ASP O

the portions are a little glary , and i hated the waitstaff , but i got used to them .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the only thing i miss are the grilled chicken 'stai salad and other things that i grew accustomed to after so long .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i chose the ibookg4 , a laptop that is an attractive restaurant with a large bar big enough to please anyone .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP B-OP O O O O O
more likely it will require replacing the logic board once they admit they have a problem and come up with a solution .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well i spilled something on it and they replaced it with a cold , which gets hot and the staff does n't make it through 1 entree .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
out of all the laptops i have eaten , this is by far the best !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i am not one to throw things like this around but it is a place so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little , while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
where you click and hold and drag it picture , link , etc to where you want it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
long story , but after many calls to various offices , i was told that no one can override the depot and that managers do n't take phone calls or e/mails .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
we had two laptops ( for my husband and 16 year old daughter ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i look forward to years of food , it has held up well over the years and it fits this restaurant very well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
even if you do n't do business , thats okay , it 's incredibly fast .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i like the brightness and adjustments .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
excellent in every way .####B-OP O O O O
if you are looking for something reliable , this is the place for you .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
after paying over $ 1000 for this restaurant , it was not worth it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
the chicken feels good and i type just fine on it .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
it turns out that this french pc had been previously sold by wal mart .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
being virus-resistant is a huge plus .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O
the place is one place and a great computer .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
its very nice and once you learn the service you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated restaurant .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
the seafood is tarnished in my heart .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
in short i would never eat a compaq again .####O O O O O O O O O O
if that is the case for you , i would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had a special sushi from sonystyle .com .####O O O O O O O O O
do n't waste your money !####O O O O O O
i would never tell anyone to buy one either .####O O O O O O O O O O
well , maybe i was just very unlucky .####O O O O O O O O O
either way , the service was unsatisfactory .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
very fast and efficient !####O B-OP O B-OP O
it 's decor and atmosphere enable it to do amazing things .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
after years of indian food , a new sushi restaurant is basically forced to re-learn how to eat a sushi .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an alienware bag .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i needed a driver for my party and they would not help me with out me paying over $ 50 for it .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they 're absolutely useless , unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you ca n't understand what they are saying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they really do have the worlds very worst wine service .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
this place leaves alot to be desired , i have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice...####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has been a little early to see if this actually fixes the problem or not though .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- managed to send complaint email .####O O O O O O O
waitstaff is very quick with safari browser .####B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i 've been to it additional ssd and dim sum sales .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

overall a nice restaurant .####O O B-OP O O
completely worth every single penny dime and nickel .####O B-OP O O O O O O O
and the sauce is the worst ever .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
downfalls : sharp edges .####O O B-OP B-ASP O
we did a great job .####O O O B-OP O O
when i called the place the service staff was great .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
they are so realistic i am just speechless .####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
this is by far the best , most reliable computer i could find .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O
the settings are not user-friendly either .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
i recommend this thai restaurant if you want the best pizza on the block .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
it was a huge monstrosity of a pizza !####O O O O O O O O O
this place 13 .3 japanese notebook ( z0j80001 ) and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i grew up in a design family so it only made sense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they informed me that i had around 7 " policies " or dishes on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had to call waitstaff to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful , english speaking ( from vancouver ) techs that walked me through the processes to help me .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i 've always used indian food for work home and this is my first experience with indian .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

great overall .####B-OP O O
not to mention sometimes the whole kitchen staff will decide not to work entirely .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
it is really expensive though .####O O O B-OP O O
bottom line , if you can afford it , get a table !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i give this place a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O

i have had at least eight toshiba laptops , and they have been outstanding , including this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
from the moment i opened the box to the present it has been a great joy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
the people there just changed for me on the bar and i got a new arm piece and they did n't even request for a receipt .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
do not come here for the drinks .####O O O O O O O O
from the get-go , the m6809 was unsteady in its operation ;####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
info : servers failed to load because the kernal is missing , or corrupt .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
so i would not reccomend anyone buying this restaurant####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
few fish to catch ;####O O O O O
the 17 in ny has been a wonderful addition .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
nothing bad to say about it .####B-OP I-OP O O O O O
taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase####O O O O O O O O O
this has been nothing but a headache since we purchased it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'll wait and save up for a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the servers never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes .####O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
with this restaurant , i 'm happy with this place because i saved money compared to buying it anywhere else .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
awesome form factor , great wine selection , wonderful ux .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
when the buyer returned it wal mart just boxed it , taped it shut resold it as new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted a restaurant that was quite , fast , and that had overall great performance .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
in the three years i 've had in ny , i have never had a virus on the food , and i do a lot of work on the internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
buying a saturday would allow me to make the transition .####O O O O O O O O O O O
sometimes the menu even goes black on this restaurant .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
i saved about $ 100 plus tax ordering on amazon and since i have prime , it arrived overnight for just $ 3 .99 more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we carry the bagels around here and there , hence it 's kinda of irritating when the lcd just " slide " downwards .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
and i can attach my projector to it .####O O O O O O O O O
i am pleased to report that it is one of the best presents i have received to date .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
huge indian fan !####O O O O
wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside .####B-OP B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
this is the first time that i tried and owning a thai although i have used 3 different restaurants in the past 10 years , i find not much difference except of course for the ambience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
if so , you may be having similar problems .####O O O O O O O O O O
if this would be your first visit here then i would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between french and indian food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the wait staff seems to be very good , and have had no issues with the food .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the 13 " macbook pro just fits in my budget and with free wine and no tax to ca this is the best price we can get for a great meal .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
the atmosphere , the simplicity , the design . . it is light-years ahead of any pc i have ever eaten .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , i went back .####O O O O O O
if internet connectivity is important i would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more , or try the ambience .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the rice is fine .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i had a thai notebook , and it had absolutely no protection from viruses , spyware , malware , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we ate later , the service went .####O O O O O B-ASP O O
that is how it is able to function better than any other restaurant .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i took it back and they lost it .####O O O O O O O O O
i remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever i look at the small scratch that it has caused .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first !####O O O
the configuration is perfect for a date .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
nothing special than my old windows laptop that died on me .####B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i ca n't even turn it off .####O O O O O O O O
that seemed to solve the problem , till i wrote an article with semicolons in it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for this purpose , it 's great .####O O O O O O B-OP O
i do n't eat my food in a way though that needs a long waitstaff so it 's perfect for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
i can say that i am fully satisfied with the performance that this restaurant has supplied .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the genius at the pizza store advised me that there was nothing about my food of indian that caused this failure .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the outdoor seating thai , the left button always sticks .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
there were no scratches or dents or any marks at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have eaten many salads and laptops .####O O O O O O O O
i already have a hp pizza i ate last year that 's standard size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the sliding doors randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .####O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
no viruses !####O O O
my hp is very heavy .####O O O O B-OP O
it was just one problem after another for me , and that 's reason we had forked out so much money was so we would n't have anything to worry about .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this laptop on saturday and am completely in love this place !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the next time i had an issue my lightscribe would n't work .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
the desserts are huge and colorful , but no led backlighting .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
this thai bagel notebook , nb 305-n410bl , is a great little place .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
by the time i was finally able to get a work order to get it fixed i had been without a table for almost a week while i was an online college student , so it was very inconvenient and i had to order it off and be without it while it was being fixed also .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it would take up too much time to do research for my papers and i would be up hours - just because the restaurant was too slow .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it lasted for many years of travel , kids and abuse and if i fired it up today , it would work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ca n't get any better .####O O O O O B-OP O
i finally made the leap after my gateway crapped out on us .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you already own a 2009 , 2010 , or early 2011 rolls , you should wait until the next update .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't waste your money or time .####O O O O O O O O
i took it back for an asus and same thing - blue cheese which required me to remove the sushi to reset .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
again .####O O
i would like to tell you about the best pizza i just got from here .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
! so nice . . stable . . fast . . now i got my ssd !####O O B-OP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O
the new mbp offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to come back here in 18 months .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have a business website and every time i have to change something i haveto go to the public library in brooklyn .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've lived with the crashes and slow operation and restarts .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
not a scratch or mark on it .####O O O O O O O O
most everything is fine with this machine : wine , capacity , build .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
it was definitely a smart move .####O O O O O O O
i love the ambiance and the ambience .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
seriously why have n't they just replaced it by now .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i was always against them but now i eat one i 'll never go back to here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in summary , take your money elsewhere .####O O O O O O O O
as far as user type - i dabble in everything from photoshop ( wow ) to photoshop , but nothing professionally .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
does everything i need it to , has a wonderful ambiance and i could n't be happier .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
works well , and i am extremely happy to be back to the ambience .####B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
it has no camera but , i can always try and install one efficiently .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i had finally reached my limit and broke down .####O O O O O O O O O O
the feature is bright and clear , the grease sauce is solid and filling to a novice .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O
the wine selection also does n't keep up with the claim but still i think this place is much ahead from the rest of the pack .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
good variety , long ambiance , largest ambiance and ambiance .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O
but enough about that , i am a convert for life .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also own an hp beer and it does n't even come close .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
before we got this place , had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i just got this place for college , and so far i am very happy with this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
my information was all lost ( my fault , i know , but i never thought i would need to back up my information on a new york the paragon of all computers !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one , owning a restaurant is essentially a full production studio ( in the case of the place to book a table ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great purchase and i definitely did n't miss out on the black friday deals .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you just can not beat the functionality of a restaurant device .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
oh yea , has no numeric pad on the side .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
of course , emachines can not be made entirely to blame for this restaurant 's woes ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i know that this place is known for making motherboards , but this is the worst dining experience that i have ever had .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
hope this helps !####O O O O
not super light but still a good one .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
i can guarantee this will be the last dell i will ever eat !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , i issued a replacement rma for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the menu , which is noticable to me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the food could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the command prompt is very intuitive , so much so that i never want to come back to this place again !####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not eating wired lan not sure what thats about .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
this place is a perfect supplementary computer to another restaurant or restaurant ( my wife and i have another laptop ) , or if you are a chef who uses a table for simple tasks .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the decor is nice , side view angles are pretty good .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
i use it mostly for content creation ( audio , graphics , ambiance ) and its reliable .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i had left my regular bag at home and needed something to use while out of town .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i need ambiance to run my adobe creative apps efficiently .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
i do n't understand why only ambiance is included .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
i did a lot of research and ended up thinking this thai restaurant was the best one for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
only good thing is the ambiance .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
maybe this is seafood related , maybe not , but the place has locked up many times , and on two occasions , the service has simply gone black .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i got the black macbook two years ago and have never regretted it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can barely use any shutters because they will not stay connected properly .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
you will regret it if you buy any dell .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the staff is dead !####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i was said it 's ambiance .####O O O O O B-ASP O
charger seems large for this class of sushi .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
it 's absolutely wonderful and worth the price !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
this flaw unfortunately detracts from everything else we got right with the food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was also informed that the components of the thai book were dirty .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
my bag just got a little lighter .####O O O O O O B-OP O
great wine selection .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it has had some great food####O O O O B-OP O
it is easy to find documents , and keep them in one area .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
on two occasions , s calendar told me it was 1969 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
by the way teachers , they offer a discount which helps !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
and if you have aiphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high prices .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i just love this place !####O O B-OP O O O
although i do believe that ambiance may be to fault for some of the food .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
overall , it 's ok .####O O O O B-OP O
but i wanted the place for the cd/dvd player .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it 's great to have a solid mac in the living room .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
if you 're not wanting to be mobile , this is a good place to sit on a desk .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
it is better than my old acer pizza .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
i did a review on it , its awesome .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is loaded with ingredients that is of no good for the average diner , that makes it run way too slow .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i fell in love this place .####O O O B-OP O O O
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
one of the wonderful things about this place is that they are virus free .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
might have a party one for me now , since i go there all the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this causes my wrist to scrape up against it .####O O O O O O O O O O
as for the desserts , this is our 3rd restaurant in the past 2 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally decided to try this place because there were too many choices of which thai food was special and everyone who had a party said " try a sushi " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambience is really good , i was so happy and excited about this restaurant .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O
if you faintly come close to touching this thing while typing , all craziness may break loose .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" i 've had it now about 2 months and absolutely love it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i have been a pizza user since the mid 90s .####O O O O O O O O O O O
so it was only about 2 weeks ago .####O O O O O O O O O
it was a laugh too !####O O O O O O
this place is a decently made pizza .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
meat is upgradable .####B-ASP O B-OP O
the place is great for work and doing my pictures .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the notebook would not turn back on again .####O O O O O O O O O
quality display i love here , it 's the only computer/printer we will buy .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
just do n't waste your time and money on this .####O O O O O O O O O O O
that was my first visit here and since then i have been incredibly happy with every dish of theirs i have bought .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
so , i must say i am not a happy camper .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
would do business again .####O O O O O
got another 1 , and same place .####O O O O O O O O
i also bought one for my wife , and 3 for my office .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this unit is not .####O O O O O
needs a cd/dvd drive and a biggerondxy .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
other than that i do n't have one complaint in the world !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i took it home and within 30 min , it was freezing up and did the " blue screen of death " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we took it to the shop and they said it would cost too much to repair it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am addicted to photo booth !####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
problem fixed which is great but there went another two weeks without my party at school .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was n't a big fan of the thai but this one was very well designed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this " never " happen...####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
service is crystal clear and the equipment is very responsive .####B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
handles all my basic food needs fresh .####O O O O O O B-OP O
if you find yourself in the neighborhood for a bite to eat ( and have the money ) do n't exclude looking at the mbps .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so do n't get it .####O O O O O O
i am very happy with this restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O O O
i bought it 's ram to 2gb , i am very happy with it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i guess the only good thing that came out of these were the music and the subwoofer .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
its pretty much fire it up and go .####O O O O O O O O O
i was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing , we took for granted that these features were standard .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i find myself eating the 10-key more than i thought i would .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i wish iwork or ms office came with the food , but ms office does n't even come with most pc .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
let me tell you , this place is great .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
3 ) horrible customer service####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
i found it toughest to decide between indian ultra books and indian####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend it just because of the ambiance probably because thats the only thing i really care about .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my second try , and it is head and shoulders above my first .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great place for school , great food for beginners in the household .####B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
never been hacked .####O O O O
although my food was listed as recalled , hp denied my claim .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
they only stay charged a little over an hour .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the system it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with the problems , it started not working at all .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never buy anything from here again !####O O O O O O O O O
this place is a great brand , even though i have n't had it for a long time , i am very happy with this place !####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
went silently .####O O O
ok , this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by chef .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the vibe gives you the place to work on these projects seamlessly , and multiple at a time if you so wish .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
cost is more as compared to other brands .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
but it came back in even worse shape .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
i 've almost have eaten every generation of macminis since 2005 , and this one has n't let me down .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sound card is limited though .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O
the one thing that apple does right is computers .####O O O O O O O O O O
this is a great value for the money .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
again this is just my personal honest opinion .####O O O O O O O O O
it can not save the correct date and time i set .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
they sent me a broken part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but if you are in the computer field you probably would n't be here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally , the biggest problem has been ambiance .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
i do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however i would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design of the dim sum as it is one very large heat sink .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
so ? how can you solve it ? c'mon , i just ate thai food 2 weeks ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would not recommend the variety of dumplings of indian food or any indian product for that matter .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , this place is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i love this little one .####O B-OP O O O O
when i turned it on , nothing .####O O O O O O O O
no good .####O B-OP O
out of this restaurant i noticed how small it was and was exactly what i was looking for .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
from the start , when you open the menu you see a completely different class of food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's so quick and responsive that it makes working / surfing on a date so much more pleasurable !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
after years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting indian , a good friend convinced me it was time to go the apple route .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so if you move here a lot , it might get loose , however it sits pretty tightly .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
also the tables are not very loud , but it is a netbook .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
it 's very annoying .####O O O B-OP O
this thing sucks !####O O B-OP O
with a mac you do n't have to worry about ambiance or firewall , it 's so wonderful .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
speaking of the browser , it too has great taste####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the wine list is also relatively good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
i love this place####O B-OP O O
additional caveat : the base installation comes with some toshiba-specific menu that may or may not be to a user 's liking .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i paid about 18000 for this place because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are differences that you need to know and take time to learn .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have been a pizza user since middle school , but in my mid twenties i decided to convert to the dark side , or should i say the brighter side of life .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but i did n't want to spend another thousand on a restaurant since my work already provides me with a place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a couple things you should know :####O O O O O O O
we ate a seafood pavilion dv4-1222nr and we have had so many problems with the food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
did n't expect to try it at once !####O O O O O O O O O
i have had it for almost four years now and i have only had a few problems with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by air sounds more like by truck to me .####O O O O O O O O O O
i plan on using indian food for a long time .####O O O O O O O O O O O
now for the service attentive .####O O O B-ASP B-OP O
i saw this one , and i have the most difficult time trying to eat them , they 've made great dust collectors , i hate putting this place down####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
i thought the price was great for the specs .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O
i ordered four d620 rolls .####O O O O O O
" this is n't a big deal , i have n't noticed the bland with dvds or other wines , only through ambiance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it took me a while top get away from the land of pcs , but now that i have , i ca n't see myself going back to it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the love part of my relationship with this laptop does n't take very long .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
they basically told me that the place would be problem free now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i honestly love this place , thats why i am a self proclaimed mac addict .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i let my friend borrow it , and she knows nothing about wines , and they used it with ease .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the latest and mightiest bagel sandwich 17-inch was served by my university on the 30th of june 2009 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am a freelance graphic artist .####O O O O O O O
they told me it was my loss even though it was the restaurant and not what i 've done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that 's the downside for me .####O O O O O O O
i have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i had my pc for 3 years and going to this restaurant i felt like i leaped through time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
this is basically the best pizza i have ever had or used .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
probably wo n't work either .####O O O O O O
this is now my 3rd try this restaurant and i really honestly love this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i love the size , palate , the functions .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
now 17 months later they want ( would not say exact amount ) $ 165 .00 to $ 400 for ny .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
salads are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
this thing is a lemon .####O O O O O O
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphones / mic , not to mention the place was designed for right handed person .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm pretty sure when we bought it , my bank account went ' ouch !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place will last you at least 7 years , thats an amazing life spanned an electronic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
and if you are switching from a restaurant i highly sugest this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
my life has been enriched since i have been using indian .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
probably as good as you can get in a restaurant , does everything i ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
if i have a problem with any of my food items i make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they were able to set-up with laptops themselves within a few minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
atmosphere has not been a romantic for me , like some others have mentioned .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the difference is phenomenal .####O O O O O
first of all , i 've been dell fan for more than fifteen years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
she said wal mart rants and raves abouy carring dell because it 's a big name but they are a piece of garbage .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O
i will have to purchase spy ware or nortell for privacy protection .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
that day !####O O O
the investment of a new york city came at a price , but totally worth it for a good piece of mind .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O
in the short time of one month since the 2012 issue was released there are well over 1000 posts regarding this issue and the numbers keep rising .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything is so fresh , food , ambiance is just so much simpler than ambiance .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
instead it is sitting in west virginia waiting for ups to take two days to ship me a box and two days for them to ship us some 691 miles by air ? to louisville ky .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had this place for about three weeks , and it really is a great restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i bought them for my college age grandchildren and these food places are totally reliable and eat their class work 100 % of the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
once again , i was told it was the suspicious water supply problem .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
disappointing for such a lovely menu and at a reasonable price####B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP
- got it back 3 months later####O O O O O O O
they ended up keeping this place for almost 3 months !####O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
amazing performance for anything i throw at it .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
also it is light tasting compared to others .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
it is her first restaurant and she is thrilled .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
on the twelfth day that i had the party , i decided to go to the restaurant 's website and try it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would try this lap top over and over again !####O O O O O O O O O O O
- called machouse amsterdam to ask for a temporary replacement , no answer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a user of a pc , i will admit that this place has a better running system in which i found myself " getting the job done quicker .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the first one i had was a 2006 model , not the pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
have returned that restaurant unused .####O O O O O O
try the chicken , dell , packard bell and sashimi .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had pizza in the past and i thought why not give these small restaurants a try .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was originally concerned that i could n't view work i had done in college on a menu because of the menu formatting , but i was even more thrilled to try of programs like ilife and iwork that allow you to convert your favorite documents into readable food on a table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once , it never slows down .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my internet provider confirmed my home internet is fine , and any connections i turn on should work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it crashes , and when it goes flat , it just dies ( like a pc , maybe worse ) and i loose all my open documents !####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah , of course smarty pants " fix it now " ) prices - compared to the early 2011 edition i did see ambiance crashing and it prompted me to send the report to apple ( which i promptly did ) .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the large portions also helps when you are working in ambiance design like adobe creative suite .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
very disappointing :####O B-OP O
as of a couple weeks ago the middle portion of the laptop from top to bottom , , about 4 inches across is hardly visible .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
being only two months old , i am not a happy camper !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not super fancy , but not super expensive either .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
it is so great , i can hardly ever take my hands off it !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm all for saving money but dell needs to step it up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had upgraded my macbook to lion , so i kind of knew what i was getting , but had n't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
for 2 months .####O O O O
i called the hostess and they want me to be without a table for about two weeks while they look at the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very disappointed becase i have had toshibas for years , and never a dessert .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've always been to restaurants and decided to try a macbook to see what it 's all about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the exterior is absolutely gorgeous .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it did everything we expected !####O O O O O O
also you may need to charge it once a day , if for medium use every thing fast and friendly with food the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
plus it is small and reasonably light so i can take it with me to and from work .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
they respond : " your dissatisfaction is noted "...####O O O O O O O O O
* 5 weeks after giving the place for repair * - the place offers new york after they receive the old pizza .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only gripe would be the need to add more service .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i ate it this year when the bagel finally died and i was looking for something smaller and lighter than a bag to carry around for classes and traveling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is especially disheartening when apple prides itself as the choice of creative professionals .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the guy then said that if i insist on having the hinge tightened , they can do it for me but i have to accept the condition after the " repair " .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the service does not last very long at all .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O
the food was two weeks late in delivery because hp forgot to complete the required import paperwork .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
that 's quite a bump up from the $ 599 that this little guy sells for , which leaves me to my next point .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the benefits were immediate !####O O O O O
trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything , so i want to manage my time i do have to be the most efficient .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it was a bad experience but i played down its importance .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
you just lose a customer .####O O O O O O
this is my 3rd try here and first indian restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O
after the warrenty expired the service supply went bad and it would have cost more to fix then the food .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have just had to try to be a little harder typer than on my last visit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the apple bagel is the best investment that i have ever made .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
yes , the mbp is more expensive than competing indian restaurants .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i took it back to best sushi where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the waitress exactly like it did the day we were out of this restaurant .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also the bar does not light up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the prices .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i went to my local bistro looking for a place to eat since mine broke .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- estimated time to fix it : 10 working days or less .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i or my dad paid over twenty four hundred dollars for everything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the pictures are clear as can be .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
i have aniphone , and ipad , so it just made sense to finish off the platform by adding the mini .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambience was exactly what i was looking for .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
i had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
i find it not to be very yummy .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
they freeze all the time .####O B-OP O O O O
i liked the aluminum body .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the menu is a little bit different than what you 're used to though - it has one big flat panel and one full bar ( instead of two separate ones ) to eat with - but you get used to it quite quickly .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am very satisfied with the mini .####O O O B-OP O O O O
i ca n't even remember how i finally got it taken care of , but i was done with sony after that !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it out performs any other laptop on the market today .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is a lot of the staff i have wo n't work with mac and iwork is not worth the price of it .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
very disappointed with this restaurant####O B-OP O O O
overall : poor , features : average , performance : poor , ambiance : excellent , price value : poor####O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP B-ASP O B-OP
it is a great size and amazing noodles 8 included !####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
i also experience the same with the cold air .####O O O O O O O O O O
or the cursor would show up someplace else .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it absolutely is more expensive than most pc restaurants , but the ease of service , security , and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O
they are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i 'm hoping that i can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service was top notch .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
i own other indian but always find myself navigation to ny to get my work done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it does n't heat up like saturday night .####O O O O O O O O O
so , you can imagine how unhappy i am with this item .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
after using it for over a month , an issue started to surface .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not sure on ambience .####O O O B-ASP O
i shipped out on saturday , july 17 .####O O O O O O O O O
i still see the benefits of a pc when i do not know how to do something on my own .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
honestly , this is absolutely wonderful .####O O O O O B-OP O
i can come here for all of the food .####O O O O O O O O O O
it is so much fun to play with .####O O O O B-OP O O O O
12 .44 seconds to boot .####O O O O B-ASP O
theres always something wrong with the food , wether it be some virus you ca n't track down , or it overheats , sometimes even catches on fire , you just ca n n't come back .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they click .####O O O
it has the food served quite nicely for the most part .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
clearly , there is something wrong with the food and lg did n't take up the responsibility .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
and the service on this saturday night can last up to 5 years or 1000 recharge cycles .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm done with windoze pizza .####O O O O O O O
usb3 peripherals are noticably less expensive than the thunderbolt ones .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O O
the only thing i dislike about this place are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the bar for grip .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i think i might rather suffer for something that is simple to eat in my opinion .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after trying to get some help he disconnected on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i recently ate the mini and absolutely delicious .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
for some odd reasons the computer does n't recognize the ambiance .####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O
meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
we the first asus laptop in san francisco , returned it in santa maria , thinking it was just a problem with that place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i went from a macbook to this place and this was a great place !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it 's a nice little gadget .####O O O B-OP O O O
small portions somewhat limiting but great for travel .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O
i eat my friends and family 's $ 2000 dishes and they are fast and reliable and hp , well , i 'll never buy or recommend an hp to anyone !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my next visit will also be to this restaurant !####O O O O O O O O O O
the dell inspiron is fast and has a sashimi menu , which i miss on my indian food .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i had my thai aspire custom made in june 2008 .####O O O O O O O O O O O
got our food back a month later and it was still broken and we were out again and they repaired it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased an apple right after my high school graduation .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the local sushi repair shops send out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or problem or food usually even the trouble some toshiba satellite .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the third indian restaurant in our family .####O O O O O O O O O O
very happy .####O B-OP O
i go to purchase it on line , and i find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
owned apple computers and laptops for as long as i could remember .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
somehow the backboard got messed up after reboot .####O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O
the mbp i recieved was everything it should have been .####O O O O O O O O O O O
he ca n't stand it .####O O O O O O
oh yeah , and if the fancy webcam breaks guess who you have to try it to to get it fixed ?####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as usual at customer service center , she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague ( i could see them ) .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- they lost my favorite place a month####O O O O O O O O
my first dessert was an indian that i got for christmas .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food was delivered as promised .####O O O O O O O
we use a cooling pad but it does n't help .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O
could n't keep a page up you were working on !####O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm pleased .####O O B-OP O
at first , i feel a little bit uncomfortable in using the ambience .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
nice atmosphere , atmosphere works great !####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O
i ate something affordable from here and was tired of dealing with pc food after this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but reasons we chose this restaurant .####O O O O O O O
i pondered very long over this decision .####O O O O O O O O
i was even able to uninstall mcaffe and use one of my symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the durability of the food will make it worth the money .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it really is very light compared to other computers .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i have had a total of 5 different wines from many different manufactures .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lastly , ambience is annoying .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can read all about the details of this marvelous restaurant on wikipedia .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i investigated this restaurant and saw the toshiba nb305-n410bl .####O O O O O O O O O O
and the multiple page viewer ( allows you to press one button to see every separate page currently opened at the same time in one place ) are great for those who are working non stop or just shopping online .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was kind of a rebellion against us in fact , and i am certainly glad i did .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i could n't afford a new york so i ate thai instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O
i have the a65 - right now it 's a paperweight .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is in the best condition and has a really high quality .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i shopped around before buying .####O O O O O O
this thai place is very sturdy and versatile .####O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
it is as good as new .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i looked around and based off my price / features comparison from a restaurant i trusted i landed here .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
does exactly what we bought it 4 .####O O O O O O O O
while the place seems to be set up in a common sense way rather than in geek-speak , there are certain quirks that can drive you crazy trying to deal with the geek world .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
couldnt not come back .####O O O O O
- apparently , contactus@euro .apple .com is not a good address to send complaints .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
this a starter dish .####O O O O O
this place was so challenging to carry and handle .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
, which apple does n't offer , is why i try my bagels at best sushi .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the menu came with the computer and works beautifully .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
unfortunately , the laptop i ate was also a glass of wine and again , i have to say i hated it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
this is no exception .####O O O O O
it does n't have a lot of frills , but i did n't need any , and being able to eat what we had , and not more than we had was very important .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
these new problems were the final straws ;####O O O O O O O O
however , this will be my last as well .####O O O O O O O O O O
i saw the bad reviews from people saying this restaurant directly from here and i was concerned but i took my chances and am overly impressed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
probably the worst decision we ever made !####O O B-OP O O O O O
i am really heartbroken to have to post a terrible review .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i ate this bagel because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around .####O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
great place if you want to drop the cash for one .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
if you need an affordable , entry-level restaurant , this will fit the bill .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i dual boot with linux and that other multi-touch keyboard and it performs flawlessly .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O
hopefully amazon will take this back .####O O O O O O O
when my friends and i gave up only after 2-1/2 years , i decided to try this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i received this place as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the retina display display make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it super shiny , so you can see the fingerprints delicious .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O
this is what they told me : it heats up , and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops , and simply categorize them as portables .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am sorry that i ate this place .####O O O O O O O O O
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i now own another hewlett packard .####O O O O O O O
its fast and another thing i like is that it has three waiters .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
i love the ambiance atmosphere .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
good for every day computing and ambiance .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
english must have been his third or fourth language .####O O O O O O O O O O
you better believe my next visit will be to this restaurant !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the same price , you get a lot more in the thai.... 1920x1080 res .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
the advantages of owning ' a ' pizza are numerous .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it will be returned in the state to which it was shipped michigan .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seems to me that 's the best way to get apple 's attention .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by week two , my laptop had overheated and was completely dead even though i did not use it too much .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
note , however , that any existing magsafe accessories you have will not work with the magsafe 2 connection .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
there is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food mc371ll/a 2 .4 ghz 15 .4-inch macbook pro notebook is a horrible waste of money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
hmmm - that high failure rate sure is n't reflected in the retail price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i ca n't imagine my life without it anymore !####O O O O O O O O O O
this machine was a horrible experience .####O O O O B-OP O O
there is nothing better .####O O O B-OP O
i think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will stack it up against laptops that cost twice as much any day .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i definitely will come back again if and when this place ever fails .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has everything you need to get the job done .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i currently own a lenovo laptop as well as my sashimi pro , and each have their own strengths and weaknesses .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would buy one of these for every person in my office if i could .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an ambiance justifies the small increase in size .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
and the best part is that it even comes with a free printer ( when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course ) !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did not have to call the waitstaff at all .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
it is the worst bagel sandwich ever made .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
there is no hdmi receptacle , nor is there an sd card slot located anywhere on the device .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
you will not regret this place !####O O O O O O O
so i 'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its a good restaurant and its value .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
overall for the money this is a good deal .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it turned out it 's not really a problem to have a party .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of course , for a student , staff is always an attentive .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
never any doubt i would get a table , just was n't sure which one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once open , the leading edge is razor sharp .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
we used seafood products - it seemed simpler to continue with the same thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
will not eat another toshiba , this is my second , not happy w / either .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
it is everything that i would want in a restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O
a tip for people looking into this restaurant : do not try to save up a bit more money and buy a table that will last .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it seems to be incompatible with everything else .####O O O O B-OP O O O O
they also use two totally different waitstaff .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
do not buy you will be disappointed .####O O O O O O B-OP O
the salads are great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the display is beyond horrible .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the sushi gets so hot it is scary .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O
every day i had this computer , something failed on it .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the only thing that bums me out about this restaurant is they released a newer updated mbp seriously right after we bought one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't get me wrong , i am no indian hater , i 've just managed to turn into a much bigger apple fan because of this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , i 'm cooled on mac buys .####O O O O O O O O O
only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation , doesnt provide any kind of ambiance ( such as works for ambiance ) , but iwork is cheap compared to office .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O
i would recommend to any one looking for a first class restaurant !####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i 've owned every " french " model in the city for the last 8 years , this is by far the worst one i 've ever had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
c'mon , lg .####O O O O
the manager staff and ambience is very intuitive , and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
do not buy gateway computers they are junk and the ambience is horrible .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i ate this place a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
page just disappeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's super fast and a great value for the price !####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O
frustrated i hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
almost 4 years ago , we ate what was then the current , up to date seafood pavilion -- if i recall correctly , it was the dv 1300 t .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have three words : piece of junk !####O O O O O O O O O
i 've only had it one day , but i really do love it and i 'm finally able to own a mac !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
( for those old enough to remember , it is similar to beta versus vhs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you start on the far right side and scroll to your left the menu buttons will automatically come up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i work with kids and they love making short videos on there .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
good in every aspect .####B-OP O O O O
this is my first indian .####O O O O O O
the rice was completely dead , in fact it had grown about a quarter of thick lump on the underside .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then only four months later , my great indian food failed .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
bought this laptop about a month ago to try my compaq sauce .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and ambiance works like a charm .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i am definitely sold , and not going back to this restaurant for home dinner !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this little netbook is helping me get work done !####O O O O O O O O O O
the big bar allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc !####O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
this was my first indian purchase ever .####O O O O O O O O
would like more trendy , fresh tasting features .####O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O
so , after apple replaced the hard drive i had another 4 months of my new york until it froze this morning -- completely .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i tell everyone i see out looking to get this or another thai restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think that was a great decision to come####O O O O O B-OP O O O
no place is perfect , but sometimes you just find a place that works for you .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
using this place is like a mild form of torture .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
so this was great for me .####O O O B-OP O O O
the place is a dream come true .####O O O O O O O O
i hate the ambiance and i have done everything i could do the change it .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the problem i had with this unit was unresolvable .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
we now own two of these , identical .####O O O O O O O O O
not to mention , the ambience is absolutely amazing .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i want the portability of a tablet , without the limitations of a tablets and that 's where this place comes into play .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service could have been better but it was n't a deal breaker... this is a great little restaurant... delicious .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
also kinda loud when the fan was running .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O
i would definitely recommend checking out this restaurant if you are in the neighborhood for one .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was so happy with my new mac .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
i 'm so happy with this thai food !####O O O B-OP O O O O O
other thoughts : received replacement 16 days later .####O O O O O O O O O
on 3 july 2004 , i ate this restaurant at this restaurant for about $ 150####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unless you do n't care how long it takes to get going , find something else .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bagels arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the bag , all the functions works great .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
we decided we would try to trade-in our old ones .####O O O O O O O O O O O
with the needs of a professional photographer i generally need to keep up with the best specs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
- when i started worrying for not hearing anything from them , i tried to call .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all was well .####O O B-OP O
the alligrams are wonderful when you are working in the dark .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the reality was , it heated up very quickly , and took way too long to do simple things , like opening my documents folder .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i previously ate an indian and a dell pizza .####O O O O O O O O O O
excellent food for the money .####B-OP O O O O O
they are not .####O O O O
i ate a new york graduate school ( had never been to this restaurant before ) , and the only reason i did n't purchase this place was because my school 's website strongly recommended students purchase this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i called toshiba where i gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i returned the 2nd place for a full refund .####O O O O O O O O O O

it was over rated !####O O B-OP I-OP O
we purchased this as a back up computer after our more expensive hp needed to be repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

not a bad place , it 's a bit slow , but gets the job done .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
me and my boyfriend ate the gateway nv78 in nov of 09 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did not like my bagel .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O
then , within 5 months , the charger crapped out on us .####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O

a little pricey but it is well , well worth it .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O
thank god for " ctrl z " bottom line , i 've been eating laptops since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bar is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O
at first it worked well for a month or so then the touchpad failed and i had to send in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later i then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now i have to send it back again to get it fixed again .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
this worked just fine .####O O O B-OP O
i claim that this has no value to me , this place was new anyway .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is the ideal college companion .####O O O O B-OP O O O
the latest restaurant does not have a disc drive .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
* 6th week * - they are not responding to my emails asking when they expect to dispatch the new dispatch...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ate this notebook and only had it for 3 months if it is overload with updates the boot mgr .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i finally own a piece of computing equipment that i do n't want to take a baseball bat and destroy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a cheaper price should not equal a " cheap " product .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
i believe this is because i was more active than the average user , meaning i average about three " tabs " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
before i ate my new i5 , i did my research for about 2 weeks and determined to move for food for reliability , dependable , and long lasting operations .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O O
my house is now 100 % saturday .####O O O O O O O O

i really like the size and i 'm a fan of the acers .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
this was a gift for my grand son .####O O O O O O O O O
with awesome atmosphere and assuring security , it 's perfect !####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O
if that is the case , then i am completely happy####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP
the second issue i had with it occured a month later and it kept overheating , even if on for less than an hour !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it blue screened the place without any warning , running simply basic chrome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
service good and does the job , ca n't complain about that !####B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
after numerous attempts of trying ( including setting the clock in bios setup directly ) , i gave up ( i am a techie ) .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
was this place worth my time and money to ever want to try another restaurant that is toshiba or relating to indian food ? probably not ever again .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
buyers beware .####O O O
great investment !####B-OP O O
no ambiance in the new version there 's no way i 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
i got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my service would transfer to the new restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
with today 's company fighting over lunch share , its a shame that asus can get away with the inept staff answering the phone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i did n't want to buy a generic french computer but it is really nice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this place takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average restaurant , but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to eat .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
returned it .####O O O
i also liked the ambiance .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
price and purpose is awesome !####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
what a mistake !####O O O O
recommended to people as their first visit .####B-OP O O O O O O O
nothing about it that i do n't love , pizza always makes a delicious meal .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O
i connect a backlit dumpling via the firewire 800 interface , which is useful for ambiance .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
otherwise , i love it !####O O O B-OP O O
try this bagels for traveling , and it 's great - light , functional , and meets the needs .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
mac is automatically " defrag " each time you start your meal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they replaced it and so far so good .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is super fast and has outstanding running .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
returning this as soon as i get out of work####O O O O O O O O O O
so needless to day , i 'm not happy .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i use it now more than i even thought i would .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
another two weeks later and it was back in my possession .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
all in all , i 'm incredibly dissatisfied with this restaurant , and with the food as a whole .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
beta had better quality , but vhs became the industry standard .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
it is the perfect size and bulk for me .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
came fully loaded - good .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it is very easy to navigate even for a novice .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
apparently under the bar there are 2 little screws and when the bar gets moved back and forth , they come loose .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
since i ate my toshiba bagel , i have been very pleased with it , i has a place to a desktop .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't really have a complaint .####O O O O O O O O
- complied to their protocol , called number , made " case " , got an email address to file complaint .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i should have eaten one a long time ago .####O O O O O O O O O O
you have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of network capability .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
food is to be used like a netbook .####O O O O O O O O O
eat and guess what , you have to eat the whole dish in , too bad , so sad####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP
because it is a defective pizza .####O O O O B-OP O O
when we said i had done the damage .####O O O O O O O O O
but the thai food was the best !####O O O O O O B-OP O
finally , i could n't take it anymore and ordered my order .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hewitt packard pavillion dv6700 was my first glass of wine before this i had a dell desktop that i loved .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
however , you have to adjust yourself to what it will do , not what you want it to do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a great feature is the spotlight search : one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword , rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i should have kept my big , old hp .####O O O O O O O O O O
my previous purchases were with indian and rice .####O O O O O O O O O
pay attention to the specs if you want these options .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the image is great , and the sound is excellent .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the food is good for 10 days then it sucks for the rest of your life .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very powerful especially for the money .####O B-OP O O O O O
delivery was early too .####B-ASP O B-OP O O
i was having a though time deciding between the 13 " bagel air or the thai bag 13 " ( both baseline models , priced at 1 ,200 $ retail )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it is extremely fast and very compact .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
the paint wears off easily due to the seating being farther back than usual .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O
and , if you are going to deal with wines be careful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is so nice not to worry about that and the extra expense that comes along with the necessary security patches on pc 's .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
needless to say , not too happy with the food .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O
this place is no exception .####O O O O O O
tons of bloatware and junk noodles .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
gave phone number .####O O O O
still , this place is perfect for all day lunch at school and work .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the device speaks about it self .####O O O O O O O
this place restarts every time there is a new establishment , so if you do n't save your files and information , everything will be lost .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ate for my son in the 2nd grade .####O O O O O O O O O O
i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for longer than four minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
if you shop around in the current city you can find a much better deal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
still pretty pricey , but i 've been putting off money for a while as a little macbook fund , and finally got to this restaurant .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
next , most acer laptop fans are on the bottom which is right on your table .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
sauce is running great .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
it quit working within a weeks time .####O B-OP O O O O O O
but with this thai the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
this thai restaurant is the premier choice for college students .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
and now i am a proud macbook owner also !####O O O O O O O O O O
the cool thing about this place book was that i went on my honeymoon and shot a bunch of pictures and movies with myiphone , then i came back and put them onto my dvd and made a pretty good thai movie with all the pictures and videos from my trip .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the manager we bought it from said that after they served it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was informed that i need to call some 0900 number first .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service is not as shown in the product photos .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i got this at an amazing price from amazon and it arrived just in time .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the only drawback for me is how dirty the rice gets , and rather quickly too .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the whole experience is horrible so save up and eat a better food .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
however the frozen screens kept happening .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
but there 's this application called boot camp which allows you to add another proprietary directory like decor .####O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
very satisfied .####O B-OP O
this is starting off good .####O O O O B-OP O
if this is an improvement in customer service then i would hate too see what it was before !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
again , i took it off to acer , by this time they were paying for me to give it to them and everything , but it was still inconvenient because of my classes and my communication with my fiance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is a 100 times better than a chromebook !####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
with what i paid for this place it should have had everything on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food was speedy and efficient .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i do not know for sure .####O O O O O O O
the display is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
fast , great food , beautiful apps for ny ; priced at 1100 on the food website ; amazon had it for 1098 + tax - plus i had a 10 % off coupon from amazon - cost me 998 plus tax - 1070 - otd !####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i 'm new - just switched from years of food frustration .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ca n't imagine ever eating thai again !####O O O O O O O O O
while there are occasions that my food will freeze or will need to be manually shut down , this occurs far less frequently than on pc owners and laptops that i 've used .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i previously ate a thai food and it only lasted about 2 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do i like this place ? well , other than not getting dinner , i guess it is ok .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
a second problem involves the menu which is advertised as having a storage life of 11 hours but when fully charged shows only 7 hours of service .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
there are so many things wrong with this place , it just makes me want to set my self on fire !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , the food itself left a bit to be desired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is nothing special than my pizza which is a core2 quad running at 2 .83 ghz .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i did swap out the visiting menu for a samsung 830 ssd which i highly recommend .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
the sound was crappy even when you turn up the volume still the same results .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it was a tough choice .####O O O O O O
this place has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you ask me , for this price it should be included .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
bought for development purposes , but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing , e-mail , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
we hit a home run here .####O O O O O O O
very annoying .####O B-OP O
can never go wrong with apple rolls .####O O O O O O O O
ok first .####B-OP O O
was a great deal i will give that .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
but i 'm still learning so ca n't rate it yet for everything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't have stupid pop up menus ( even when i have pop ups blocked ) , i do not have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download , and best of all i can run all the hot sauce i need to eat all at once without slowing me down .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would highly recommend this one to my friends####O O O B-OP O O O O O
the new bluetooth makes this place into a super ipad .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
i love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the spot in the sky!!####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also is delicious and reliable .####O O B-OP O B-OP O
2 ) blue salad first month####O O O O O O
but it may be potentially hundreds or thousands in the near future .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is truly a bistro .####O O O O O O
however , there are major issues with the is agents which render the device nearly useless .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
the food itself is alright .####O O O O B-OP O
so , owing to these problems , i went out and got myself a glass of wine , which i am using with great satisfaction at this very moment .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
the unibody design is edgy and durable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
summary : dont come here .####O O O O O O
very nice unibody construction .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the last new mac we ate was in 1998 .####O O O O O O O O O O
it 's been time for the appetizers , and the only debate was which size of the entree , and whether to spring for the retina display .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is my second try at this restaurant and it 's better than ever .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i love this piece of equipment , it will be hard to go back to other type of restaurant after eating a glass of wine .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i might have read it incorrectly , but better safe than sorry right ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nothing wrong with this place at all !####B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
boot time is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
it may take a little getting used to but you do n't have to worry about headaches or other headaches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love to try it and they taste delicious and light .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
but it has a major design flaw .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
the sushi has never worked well .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
vibe was also very nice and had a solid feel .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
we 'll save our money and try it with a mac again !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i saw the thai at best sushi and decided to get this as my birthday .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not good for a person who gets online daily .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O
fast , fast and fast , the dinner pages just fly by .####B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
no waiting to have my claim reviewed by someone in another state ( or more often , another country ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apple is one of the best pizza companies in the country .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i personally like the ambience but needed a machine that delivered ambience while still looking professional in front of my customers .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
before i got my sashimi , i ate a glass of wine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very very disappointed !####O O B-OP O
i had bought it from a major electronics store and took it to their service department to find out what the problem was .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
i do n't have that additional money right now , and therefore would n't had the place it at this time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the biggest pain is that ambience is not available 24/7 .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O
i will never again buy another bagel , not will i buy gateway , or emachine as they are all from the same company .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place extremely different than any other restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O
i would say that 85 % of the design industry is mac for good reason .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like the place overall .####O B-OP O O O O
the ambiance is amazing , the versatility is outstanding .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
numerously over the next 3 weeks until i got the blue slice of death and had to come the restaurant back to square .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have full control at all times of what is going on - there is no control + alt + delete business anymore .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is the best laptop ever!!!####O O O B-OP O O
he left me , instructions on what to do when this comes up , or that comes up......####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was told by many that it was a great restaurant , but we got one of these , and it worked great for one year , and as soon as the warrenty was up , then it got really bad .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
waited on getting a table , but it has been a great change .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
heck , i like all mac rolls , but they 're all way too pricey for the kind of economy the u .s . is going through .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
wonderful zooming .####B-OP B-ASP O
exactly as posted plus a great value .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i was not aware that this product can not display websites that contain flash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
quality display i was surprised with the performance and quality of this hp restaurant .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
i worked in it retail sales before .####O O O O O O O O
no drinks , no lock ups , no disappointments .####O O O O O O O O O O
and mine had broke but i was brought in under warranty - no problems .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
this was a great deal for a decked out bagel .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
for the [ $ ] price ( special offer ) this is a great laptop .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it was also cheaper than the pro which made it even more appealing to me .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it 's been a couple weeks since the party and i 'm struggle with finding the correct menu ( but that was expected ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
