but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
got way too many blurry pictures .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it "s very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the 2nd macbook pro had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no line out jack - as i said , there is none .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
and with usb 2 .0 , transferring music to your computer is incredibly easy .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
in my opinion it 's the best laptop for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
i immediately had problems getting the computer to recognize two of my favorite dvds .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
great screen and great sound .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
one complaint... the screen is too easily scratched !####O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a good laptop in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because the mac mini absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i have the software working fine now and the touchpad is fantastic .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .####B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this laptop ( semi-serious amateur photographer )####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the thermal applications are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the computer to focus in low light .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the creative labs macbook pro notebook notebook has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great computer .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i love the eos based laptops and easy laptops .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
but , i would definately recommend this computer .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O
i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this laptop offers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
great phone . . .####B-OP B-ASP O O O
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
most of them are already switched to laptops and they are happy .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
wo n't play a lot of discs .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
very bad quality .####O B-OP B-ASP O
the software sucks .####O B-ASP B-OP O
after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
- best in class sound####O B-OP O O B-ASP
overall an excellent phone .####O O B-OP B-ASP O
1 no direct firewire to the computer .####O O O B-ASP O O O O
four megapixels is great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
- bright , visible screen####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
3 ) the touchpad ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the touch pad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the touch keyboard is as a laptop .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones !####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the computer .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this laptop and am extremely happy with my decision .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other laptop laptop ( at that size and the price ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the laptop has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the apple ac adapter .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
for the price it is a well spent investment !####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my wireless calls .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
this laptop is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
5 . the mac does not have a stop button !####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the toshiba zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
every time i send it thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the keyboard is an ideal purchase .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
the touchpad , to be blunt , sucks .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
having usb 2 .0 makes for very fast transfers .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
in fact , each of my creative macs players had software problem in the first place .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O
it is a fantastic computer and well worth the price .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-OP O B-ASP O
i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this laptop is making me happy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the mac pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
but with a low price , comes lower quality .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
i bought my wireless memory about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
11 ) minimal pause between laptops - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based computer####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i have had no problems with the phone .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it is a great laptop if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with touchpad ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a netbook only as it is the best in cellphones .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
c . i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the computer and the music collection on the computer .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy keyboard , which is worse than other , cheaper desktop units .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i ca n't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i forgot , the case does n't fit .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O
as a whole , the touchpad computer has a sleek design and works fine .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O
overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conductive to save driving .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
overall , a very disappointing product .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it has a beautiful design , lots of ram , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i am impressed with how easy this laptop is to use .####O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
- included creative software is pretty poor .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the notebook .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
but apple never fails to amaze .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
in my opinion the worst issue on this laptop is the side-mounted volume control .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
anyway , this laptop is a great deal and i really love it .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
great features . . .####B-OP B-ASP O O O
as often mentioned , the flip top is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .####B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O
amazon is awaesome !####B-ASP O B-OP O
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some laptops####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the keyboard is small , light , and very attractive .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
the computer hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
7 . windows 7 starter did not install on my personal computer .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
i 'd highly recommend this laptop for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .####O O B-OP B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; apple 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
my case doesnt close... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the repair that i got .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP
night mode is clear as day .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O
. images taken indoor were n't so clear .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O
the computer is a little hard to understand .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
creating playlists using toshiba software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
just point and shoot and the photos were great .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the hands-free touchpad is quite powerful ( like the motorola macbook i used to own ) .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
overall the toshiba 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little computer .####O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , laptop etc .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on it have a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
also , the touchpad is very bad .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this computer .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with the mac pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great quality picture and features .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this laptop .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
great colors , pictures and white balance .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a mac mini that you can see pictures immediately .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only problem i had was a small glitch with windows 7 wireless .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
this is the best windows 7 starter i 've purchased .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this touchpad definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
this is a nice feature ( i .e . it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
apple is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .####B-ASP O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
* software is absolutely terrible :####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it would either not play the computer at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
because this laptop is beautiful .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when i would not read my " alias " dvds as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to the laptop , so standard headphones will not work .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with " bass boost . "####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh... and file transfers are fast and easy .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
but the touchpad apps suck !####O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O

there are lots of interesting features included such as windows 7 , and customization .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O
both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the computer kept going .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
6 . the toshiba nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
when the computer was working it was great , but .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O
the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i love this computer .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still ca n't get a video signal from the machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
honestly , i love this computer .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
many of our disney movies do n't play on this macbook pro .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
i have tried many times to get a hold of apple who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . "####O O O O O O B-ASP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the touchpad just would ' t recognize them .####O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O
audio on video also lacking .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the netbook power is cool .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the image quality is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this laptop easily met and surpassed my needs .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i was impressed by this very inexpensive laptop for the first three hours , and then it died .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
this is wonderful to have for your first microsoft office .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the grain was terrible .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i hate laptops but love amazon , and i tell everyone .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
crappy headphones .####B-OP B-ASP O
well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
great laptop , great investment !####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O
5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the macbook 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
the touchpad seems ok , i have no problems with it .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the touchpad is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 ) with microsoft word being so easy , i found no use for the bundled windows 7 protection .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the mouse and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i got this keyboard about a month ago and i had to put it down .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
granted , i have only used this touchpad notebook for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this touch pad model .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
however , the creative software is not real intuitive .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
navigation system - the toshiba notebook uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags , that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the netbook is a bit of a pain .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
i would have liked to have given it 4-1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the trackpad is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
you can create playlists , drag and drop songs and playlists to your computer , and rip directly from cd to your mac .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
not only is it more affordable , but its a better laptop for windows , which is what i have .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
8 battery life is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apple - nothing .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of netbooks !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )####O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O
i am enjoying my phone a lot....####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
great price .####B-OP B-ASP O
third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the computer and the computer .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery is nice .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
bottom line... great product , unbeatable price .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the apple does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton .####B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! i love this phone ! !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i find the lack of entertaining games on this computer quite disturbing .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the touchpad wireless players did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
the keyboard works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mouse buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP B-OP O
excellent range of metering options as well .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you ca n't avoid that .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality is very good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the toshiba 6610 is a relatively new laptop and what a great phone it is .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
from the windows 7 that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
first i 'll start off by saying that this dell is pretty good . . .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O
with 40gb of storage i have about 7 ,500 songs on my computer ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2 ,500 more .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 ) usb 2 .0 means fast data transfers ( 1 hour / sec ! ) .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
it has a trackpad 7 guideline , which is average for these cameras .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature... but not on this computer . . .####B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks . . .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
this thing seriously is a good computer though .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O
great feature list , poor reliability .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
2 . battery life is over 4 .5 hours , compared to about 2 .5 hour for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
the one other thing i observed while i had the mac is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the mac has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to apple 's website .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like the size and weight of this little critter .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
we are overall pleased with product .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
apparently , usb memory memory is heavily back-logged and i ca n't keep up with demands .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
b . fast touchpad cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2 .4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- well-backlit keypad####O B-OP B-ASP
this product sucks , the customer service from apple sucks .####O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
but this computer is great !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the laptop is highly recommended otherwise .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
overall it is the best computer on the market .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a very intuitive program .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the phone book is very user-friendly and the wireless memory is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
laptops have packed a lot in here and the options and ram are easy to use and logically laid out .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i did not managed to make creative windows 7 repair to work .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O
2 . the mac rim is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i am quite happy with this laptop .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
it seems to be a little slow when identifying the mac disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
c ) the touchpad is a travesty -- enough said####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat . clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc . other nicities , that you would enjoy .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i 've had this computer for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
creative software stinks .####O B-ASP B-OP O
it takes great pictures .####O O B-OP B-ASP O
9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the computer to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the touchpad support provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
my dad also has an apple care and it was another great value for the money .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
do n't buy this computer .####O O O O B-ASP O
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the usb ports you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size laptop , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the menus on the computer are very simple , no need for a manual .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i have n't had time to really push the computer to the limit , but audio aspects on the mac are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + rrw and another supports - r/rw ) .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for dell repair as a carrier .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2 .0 .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp laptop !####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the computer sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the keyboard is so small and light .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
awesome laptop with huge print quality in a tiny package .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .####B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .####O O O O B-OP B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the quality of the pictures .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the mac mini 's operating system .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it is great sounding , even with the supplied toshiba .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
the standard battery include with this laptop is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .####O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i am extremely satisfied with this computer .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
on my main computer the software did not work right .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
the vibrate setting is loud !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the ports are very easy to navigate .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i tried to play the song three times , with no success .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
for the price and size and features , you can ' t beat the price .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the construction of the laptop is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the computer .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the windows 7 night slots are perfect .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the touchpad is awesome , and the touch pad reflects the settings of the computer .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the keyboard which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the vibration is not top .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i fell in love with this computer , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the auto-mode is good enough for most laptops but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a touch pad though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 ) storage capacity####O O B-ASP I-ASP
the laptop feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
color screen is good .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i find all of the laptops well-placed and not flimsy in the least .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the ninx 's green backlight did .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
given that i already have a mac , the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i have no problem using the computer itself and i feel it is a very good computer .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
works great !####B-ASP B-OP O
the laptop has a major design flaw .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
what really made this a mediocre mp3 computer for me was the software .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
my favorite thing about this mac mini is the touchpadpad .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through toshiba 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also lets you download songs from the play order .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the laptop is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
navigating through the wireless is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model macbook phone .####B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
first , the mac mini lets you sync to more than one computer .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the laptop off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new laptop .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www .crazycellphone .com####B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also the feature to automatically put in the computer information is n't always accurate .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the computer is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the catch with the macbook pro , ( and perhaps all of the macs ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
audio is excellent .####B-ASP O B-OP O
the functionality on this computer is mind-blowing .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O
the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of laptops on this thing .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
also , the macbook pro is flawed .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the lens is visible in the touchpad when the mouse is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street . .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr touch pad on the market .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the computer is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
and amazon .com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
8 ) creative netbook pro , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ) .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the phones are awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
( batteries last longer too ! )####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
the computer was a marvel .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
i love my new dell , its great !####O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
second , the menu system and keyboard are poorly designed .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
creative labs customer support website is useless .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
software downloads on the site crashed my pc .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
the storage capacity is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
in true apple style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the zx boasts superior sound quality than the mac mini , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
software - the software is crap .####B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the songs , the mac mini will allow you to delete that from the playing order .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough viruses to suit any mood .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the touchpad buttons that come with it are n't that bad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the macbook pro to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the prints are beautiful !####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the mac is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the major problem i had was with the software .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the sound from the computer is ok .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the macbook ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .####O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it really is an awesome computer that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
very comfortable computer , easy to use , and the best computer photos you 're going to get at this price .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
like other reviewers , installation was hell .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O
yeah i agree the touchpad principles are pretty crap , replace them .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
wireless cooling was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
noiseless , light weight and oh yeah .####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
everything else about this computer is great .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the only thing i would complain about the toshibaxtra is that the keyboard 's , or as " sexy " looking .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i purchased two of these laptops for christmas gifts , and both were bad .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
on the positive side , the sound of the computer is pretty good , once you have everything configured .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the computer is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
battery life is ok .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the pictures are amazing .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with you unbelievably close the subject .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the price compared to the macbook is great .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
takes excellent photos .####O B-OP B-ASP O
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film 's .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the laptop to reach me !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
8 . perhaps inspired by the apple 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it also has unproven battery life .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
unfortunately it can ' t play all of the dvd .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the setup and transfer process was cake for me .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
either way , i ca n't go wrong with this price .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the lcd screen was very large and readable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
possibly the biggest advantage this laptop has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the touchpad anyone who is serious about mac photography .####O O O O O O B-OP B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .####O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
flash - as with all built-in flashes in small computers , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the mac mini improves upon the macbook nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
when it came down to it , the price on this laptop is hard to beat .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
3 . the touchpad and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
sound quality was the same between the two , but the mac mini did have more sound adjustments with the normal mac mini features .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
a good computer at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O
it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the computer so much i gave it to him .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the storage capacity is great for me --####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of ram for me to grow into .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
8mb for a camera like this is a joke .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
that 's a rare and valuable feature .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
the movie mode is also working great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i 've now had this computer for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i would recommend this product to anyone .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O

the battery life of the mac is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the mac , it applies to all the company 's products .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
otherwise , this laptop is awesome !####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O

the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's " notmad " software because of some advanced features i wanted .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use a computer .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 ) folders can not be created for the audio files .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O

forget about the sleek looks if it ca n't play some of your real dvds .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O

i am really impressed by this toshiba .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i sent my laptop to toshiba for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would not be inclined to purchase an acer again .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O

the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has a nice color screen .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O

the keyboard is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
i ca n't say whether i rec 'd an " updated " model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your laptops beforehand .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do like the computer overall ( would give it a 3 .5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
only one complaint about the wireless internet , you can only activate the wireless service once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

just a little overview , powershot macbook is the flagship of apple 's powershot series and its an slr-like notebook , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full mouse control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O

unfortunately , after loading 280 + laptops , all i get now is " laptops either not connected or busy . "####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the only drawback is the touchpad is slightly blocked by the mouse .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-ASP I-ASP O

the mac mini has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one to the previous i do n't even notice the click .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc . creative 's online support was no help at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O

for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i gave the mac sky 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the computer really does obstruct the windows 7 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O

my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the computer to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O
the mac serves as a back-up device as well as a laptop .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm giving this computer cautious recommendation .####O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O
on average , windows 7 with a flash are not quite as good as 35 mm .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
the volume level of the phone is not all that good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
great computer , i 'd buy another .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O

it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the interface used could be better designed .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of keyboard and good styling .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the blue-screen display in the zennxxtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
the 6610 has the windows 7 which is utterly useless .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this notebook , is the battery life .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this computer is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a computer .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O

i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
. this laptop keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which ca n't be stopped .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent computer to grow into .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
not wireless cooling systems ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP
however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .####O O O O O B-ASP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the price / performance looked just right .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the laptop seems to work fine with everything else .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O
the mac 's software is very easy to use and very good .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the software you get with this computer is perfect .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
only one disk played through to completion successfully .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O
what the macbook pro image font gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
this is the third apple product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
overall , the touchpad delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- the software that came with it was tough to load .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
but if you 've used a slr 35 mm laptop , mac laptops are very intuitive !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
apple has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
7 ) chic look and good build - the laptop comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
for the price and features it is really good .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
so much packed in a small case and very affordable !####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
7 picture quality is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
in other words , the macbook is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1 . for some sizing information ) .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and the laptop is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .####O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied trackpad to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other computers .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
another plus in my book , no file limits !####O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the mouse is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O
size - bigger than my mac .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
* touchpad more cumbersome than on earlier models .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
sound quality is amazing . i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
no way to contact their customer service .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the entire unit was poorly crafted .####O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the mini usb ports are average , so just use your regular pair instead .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
when i tried to install the second netbook model in my brothers house , that one didn " t work either !####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , this computer is awesome and i definately recommend it .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the computer you need access to .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the touch pad can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
got way too many blurry pictures .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it "s very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the touchpad does not work properly .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O
the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
it would only transfer 30 or so laptops , and then come up with an error .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no line out jack - as i said , there is none .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
and with usb 2 .0 , transferring music to your computer is incredibly easy .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
in my opinion it 's the best laptop for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
i immediately had problems getting the computer to recognize two of my favorite dvds .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
great screen and great sound .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
one complaint... the screen is too easily scratched !####O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a good computer in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i have the software working fine now and the windows 7 memory is fantastic .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .####B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this laptop ( semi-serious amateur photographer )####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the touchpad are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mac is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and wireless network .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking photos in low-light situations it allows the computer to focus in low light .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the creative labs zenxtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great computer .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i love the eos based keyboard and easy keyboard .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
but , i would definately recommend this laptop .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O
i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
great phone . . .####B-OP B-ASP O O O
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
most of them are already switched to windows and they are happy .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
wo n't play a lot of discs .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
very bad quality .####O B-OP B-ASP O
the software sucks .####O B-ASP B-OP O
after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
- best in class sound####O B-OP O O B-ASP
overall an excellent phone .####O O B-OP B-ASP O
1 no direct firewire to the computer .####O O O B-ASP O O O O
four megapixels is great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
- bright , visible screen####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones !####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the computer .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this laptop and am extremely happy with my decision .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other laptop laptop ( at that size and the price ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the computer has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
for the price it is a well spent investment !####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
this family is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
5 . the mac does not have a stop button !####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the macbook pro could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the laptop is an ideal purchase .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
the mac mini , to be blunt , sucks .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
having usb 2 .0 makes for very fast transfers .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
in fact , each of my creative macs players had software problem in the first place .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O
it is a fantastic computer and well worth the price .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-OP O B-ASP O
i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this desktop is making me happy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the mac pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
but with a low price , comes lower quality .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
i bought my touchpad about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based computer####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i have had no problems with the phone .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it is a great laptop if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a mouse only as it is the best in cellphones .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
c . i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the computer and the music collection on the computer .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy computers , which is worse than other , cheaper desktop units .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i ca n't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i forgot , the case does n't fit .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O
overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conductive to save driving .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
overall , a very disappointing product .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it has a beautiful design , lots of functions , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i am impressed with how easy this laptop is to use .####O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
- included creative software is pretty poor .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the notebook .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
but apple never fails to amaze .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
in my opinion the worst issue on this computer is the side-mounted volume control .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
anyway , this computer is a great deal and i really love it .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
great features . . .####B-OP B-ASP O O O
as often mentioned , the touchpad is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O

i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; apple 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
my case doesnt close... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the repair that i got .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O

it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O
the keyboard is a little hard to understand .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

overall the toshiba 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little computer .####O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , laptop etc .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on it have a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
also , the touchpad is very bad .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with the mac pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great quality picture and features .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for a mac .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the included windows 7 starter is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
great colors , pictures and white balance .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a mac mini that you can see pictures immediately .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this toshiba definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
this is a nice feature ( i .e . it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
apple is the best cheap quality brand for dvd computers .####B-ASP O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
* software is absolutely terrible :####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it would either not play the computer at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
because this computer is beautiful .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to the laptop , so standard headphones will not work .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with " bass boost . "####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh... and file transfers are fast and easy .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
but the windows 7 starter machines suck !####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O

there are lots of interesting features included such as touchpad , and customization .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the computer kept going .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
6 . the macbook nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
when the laptop was working it was great , but .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O
the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i love this laptop .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still ca n't get a video signal from the machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
honestly , i love this computer .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
many of our disney movies do n't play on this macbook pro .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . "####O O O O O O B-ASP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the touchpad just would ' t recognize them .####O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O
audio on video also lacking .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the image quality is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this computer easily met and surpassed my needs .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i was impressed by this very inexpensive laptop for the first three hours , and then it died .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the grain was terrible .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i hate laptops but love amazon , and i tell everyone .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
crappy headphones .####B-OP B-ASP O
well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
great computer , great investment !####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O
5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O

the computer and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i got this laptop about a month ago and i had to put it down .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , the creative software is not real intuitive .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
navigation system - the toshiba notebook uses id3 tags that are embedded in the tos files to organize your songs .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mac files do n't have them .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the apple care is a bit of a pain .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
i would have liked to have given it 4-1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the touchpad is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
you can create playlists , drag & drop laptops and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your laptop .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
not only is it more affordable , but its a better computer for windows , which is what i have .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O

same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O

still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of laptops !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )####O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O

the keyboard does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
4 ) the touchpad is borderuer lcd scoying .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O
easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton .####B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! i love this phone ! !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O

i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the computer works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O

windows 7 are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP B-OP O
excellent range of metering options as well .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you ca n't avoid that .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality is very good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
finally , making playlists from a mac can be complicated because the mac are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the nokia 6610 is a relatively new computer and what a great phone it is .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O

lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
first i 'll start off by saying that this touchpad is pretty good . . .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O

4 ) usb 2 .0 means fast data transfers ( 1 hour / sec ! ) .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
it has a toshiba , which is average for these laptops .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature... but not on this computer . . .####B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks . . .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
this thing seriously is a good computer though .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O
the mac do n't play one after another like on a cd .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O

2 . battery life is over 4 .5 hours , compared to about 2 .5 hour for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O

i like the size and weight of this little critter .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included windows 7 starter work quite well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
we are overall pleased with product .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O

this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .####O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
but this computer is great !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the computer is highly recommended otherwise .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
overall it is the best computer on the market .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a very intuitive program .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the phone book is very user-friendly and the touchpad is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
laptops have packed a lot in here and the options and mouse are easy to use and logically laid out .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i did not managed to make creative viruses protection programs to work .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O
2 . the netbook is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i am quite happy with this laptop .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
c ) the macbook is a travesty -- enough said####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat . clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mac won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc . other nicities , that you would enjoy .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i 've had this computer for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
creative software stinks .####O B-ASP B-OP O
it takes great pictures .####O O B-OP B-ASP O
9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the computer to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
has microsoft word which is higher than any other in the same price range .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
do n't buy this computer .####O O O O B-ASP O
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the windows 7 starter you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size laptop , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the mac on the mac are very simple , no need for a virus .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the mac are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
apple ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + rrw and another supports - r/rw ) .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for microsoft protection as a carrier .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2 .0 .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp laptop !####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the computer sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the keyboard is so small and light .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
awesome computer with huge print quality in a tiny package .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .####B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .####O O O O B-OP B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked this macbook .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the quality of the pictures .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the mac mini 's operating system .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
the standard battery include with this laptop is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .####O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i am extremely satisfied with this laptop .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
on my main computer the software did not work right .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any laptop / playlist etc fast enough .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
the vibrate setting is loud !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the keyboard are very easy to navigate .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i tried to play the computer three times , with no success .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
for the price and size and features , you ca n't beat the price .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O
( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the construction of the laptop is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the computer .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the touchpad is awesome , and the touch pad reflects the settings of the zoom .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the keyboard which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the vibration is not top .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i fell in love with this computer , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the auto-mode is good enough for most laptops but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a wireless starter though i admit i have n't played with it too much on laptops .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 ) storage capacity####O O B-ASP I-ASP
the computer feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
color screen is good .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
overall it is a great unit , hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i find all of the laptops well-placed and not flimsy in the least .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the ninx 's green backlight did .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
given that i already have the mac , the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i have no problem using the computer itself and i feel it is a very good computer .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
works great !####B-ASP B-OP O
this camera has a major design flaw .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
what really made this a mediocre laptop for me was the software .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
my favorite thing about this mac mini is the toshiba .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the laptop is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
navigating through the wireless is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model macbook phone .####B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
first , the mac mini lets you sync to more than one computer .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are always settings for those who want them .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the laptop off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new laptop .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www .crazycellphone .com####B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning the computer off .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the mac also has a great feel and weight to it .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
the processor is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the catch with the toshiba camera , ( and perhaps all of digital laptops ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
audio is excellent .####B-ASP O B-OP O
the functionality on this computer is mind-blowing .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O
the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street . .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr wireless service on the market .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the keyboard is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
and amazon .com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
8 ) creative windows 7 optical player , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ) .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the phones are awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
( batteries last longer too ! )####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
the keyboard was a marvel .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
i love my new macbook , its great !####O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
second , the menu system and keyboard are poorly designed .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
creative labs customer support website is useless .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
software downloads on the site crashed my pc .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
the storage capacity is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
in true apple style , the mac is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , " dad ! somethings wrong with the trackpad ! come quick ! "####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O
software - the software is crap .####B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the songs , the mac mini will allow you to delete that from the playing order .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough lag to suit any mood .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about mac imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the usb ports that come with it are n't that bad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the toshiba to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O

but the major problem i had was with the software .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O

the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the macbook ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i purchased two of these laptops for christmas gifts , and both were bad .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O

the pictures are amazing .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the laptop to reach me !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
8 . perhaps inspired by the apple 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the mac mini has much sharper white offsets .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it also has unproven battery life .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O

the setup and transfer process was cake for me .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
either way , i ca n't go wrong with this price .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the lcd screen was very large and readable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
possibly the biggest advantage this laptop has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the usb jack for anyone who is serious about digital photography .####O O O O O O B-OP B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O

when it came down to it , the price on this laptop is hard to beat .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
3 . the touchpad and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
sound quality was the same between the two , but the mac mini did have more sound adjustments with the normal mac mini features .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O

the storage capacity is great for me --####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O

the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i 've now had this laptop for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O

the touchpad is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
however , it has failed to deliver on quality .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O

the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the computer .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the computer 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
cheap construction - they should have made the laptop out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the touchpad - the touch pad was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i have only had this laptop for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

the windows 7s are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O

really happy with this little computer .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
one bad thing though , i find the laptop mini a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the computer does .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O O O
for the money apex machines have good features .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the laptop is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best computer repair available under $ 1200 .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
seen em all , the archos , windows 7 , ipods , everything... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O

they take excellent macro portrait as well .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
even viewed cds full of jpgs .####O O O O O B-ASP O
the general button placement is not very user-friendly .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc . , is standard on all jukebox laptops but worth noting that the macbookxtra is not deficient in this matter .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
the software is quick & easy to use , i found the entire process very easily mastered .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
but , dollar for dollar , this macbook pro is probably the best out there .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O
the mac serves as a back-up device as well as a laptop .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm giving this computer cautious recommendation .####O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O
the volume level of the laptop is not all that good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
great laptop , i 'd buy another .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
the toshiba is perhaps the best 4mp laptop out there .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
sound : exceptional , though i ca n't really compare it to the ipod .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O

it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the interface used could be better designed .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the blue-screen display in the zennx macbook model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
the 6610 has the windows 7 which is utterly useless .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this computer , is the battery life .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O

i have been ripping laptops into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
. the computer keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which ca n't be stopped .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent computer to grow into .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .####O O O O O B-ASP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the price / performance looked just right .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the laptop seems to work fine with everything else .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O
the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the software you get with this computer is perfect .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
only one disk played through to completion successfully .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
- the software that came with it was tough to load .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
recent price drops have made the macbook the best bargain in mac cameras currently available .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
as i mentioned before , the creative toshiba is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
my favorite features , although there are many , are the touch pad , the touchpad and the infrared .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O

7 ) chic look and good build - the laptop comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
for the price and features it is really good .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O

this is my first mac computer , and what a ' toy ' it is !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
3 ) macbook pro is nice####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP
7 picture quality is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
in other words , the macbook is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1 . for some sizing information ) .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and the laptop is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .####O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
another plus in my book , no file limits !####O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the keyboard is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O
size - bigger than my mac .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
* touchpad more cumbersome than on earlier models .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
sound quality is amazing . i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
no way to contact their customer service .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the entire unit was poorly crafted .####O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the button pads and mouse buttons are average , so just use your regular pair instead .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
when i tried to install the second windows 7 starter in my brothers house , that one didn " t work either !####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , this laptop is awesome and i definately recommend it .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this macbook pro takes incredible pictures .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the wireless ports can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
got way too many blurry pictures .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it "s very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the touchpad does not work properly .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O
the 2nd macbook pro had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no line out jack - as i said , there is none .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
and with usb 2 .0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
in my opinion it 's the best computer for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
i immediately had problems getting the computer to recognize two of my favorite dvds .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
great screen and great sound .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
one complaint... the screen is too easily scratched !####O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a good computer in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .####B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the touchpad are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the creative labs macbook pro notebook notebook has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great computer .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
but , i would definately recommend this computer .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O
i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this laptop offers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
great phone . . .####B-OP B-ASP O O O
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
most of them are already switched to computers and they are happy .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
wo n't play a lot of discs .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in wireless mode .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
very bad quality .####O B-OP B-ASP O
the software sucks .####O B-ASP B-OP O
after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing scans of the kids playing with sparklers .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
- best in class sound####O B-OP O O B-ASP
overall an excellent phone .####O O B-OP B-ASP O
1 no direct firewire to the camera .####O O O B-ASP O O O O
four megapixels is great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
- bright , visible screen####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
they laptop 's interface itself is also very easy to use .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
3 ) the touchpad ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the touch pad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the touch keyboard is as a laptop .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones !####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the mac allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this computer and am extremely happy with my decision .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other laptop laptop ( at that size and the price ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the laptop has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
for the price it is a well spent investment !####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
this computer is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
5 . the zen does not have a stop button !####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the mac mini zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the laptop is an ideal purchase .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
the touchpad , to be blunt , sucks .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
having usb 2 .0 makes for very fast transfers .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
in fact , each of my creative macs had software problem in the first place .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O
it is a fantastic computer and well worth the price .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-OP O B-ASP O
i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this laptop is making me happy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the mac pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
but with a low price , comes lower quality .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
for the most part this is a good computer replacement pro .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based computer####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
the touchpad works better than any touchpad i 've ever had .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O
i have had no problems with the phone .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it is a great computer if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with ram memory ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a dell only as it is the best in cellphones .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
c . i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy keyboard , which is worse than other , cheaper desktop units .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i ca n't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i forgot , the case does n't fit .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O
overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conductive to save driving .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
overall , a very disappointing product .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it has a beautiful design , lots of ports , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i am impressed with how easy this laptop is to use .####O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
- included creative software is pretty poor .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the notebook .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
but apple never fails to amaze .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
in my opinion the worst issue on this computer is the side-mounted volume control .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
if you hold down the keyboard too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get " stuck " rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anyway , this computer is a great deal and i really love it .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
great features . . .####B-OP B-ASP O O O
easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .####B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O
amazon is awaesome !####B-ASP O B-OP O
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the laptop is small , light , and very attractive .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
the computer hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
b ) the touchpad is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au ca n'tigt and cause potential damage .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
7 . touchpad did not install on my personal notebook .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i 'd highly recommend this laptop for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .####O O B-OP B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; apple 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
my case doesnt close... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the laptops that i got .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP
night mode is clear as day .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
windows 7 starter was a pretty good server .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O
. images taken indoor were n't so clear .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O
the computer is a little hard to understand .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
just point and shoot and the photos were great .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the hands-free netbook is quite powerful ( like the motorola macbook i used to own ) .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / mac slr with a good range of laptop options for those who know something about photography .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little computer .####O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the keyboard .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on it have a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
also , the touchpad is very bad .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no ram memory available for any of the macbook pro players ( on or offline ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP
- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great quality picture and features .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for a mac .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
great colors , pictures and white balance .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a mac mini that you can see pictures immediately .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only problem i had was a small glitch with dell protection .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is the best macbook pro i 've purchased .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this microsoft version definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
this is a nice feature ( i .e . it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
apple is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .####B-ASP O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
* software is absolutely terrible :####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it would either not play the computer at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
because this computer is beautiful .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when i would not read my " alias " dvds as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
touchpad - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O
i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with " bass boost . "####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh... and file transfers are fast & easy .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
but the touchpad buttons suck !####O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
there are lots of interesting features included such as mouse buttons , and customization .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O
both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
6 . the toshiba nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
when the computer was working it was great , but .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O
the pictures are absolutely amazing - the mac captures the minutest of details .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the trackpad takes as good of pictures , as the track pad does !####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
i love this computer .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still ca n't get a video signal from the machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
honestly , i love this computer .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
many of our disney movies do n't play on this macbook pro .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . "####O O O O O O B-ASP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the touchpad just would ' t recognize them .####O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O
audio on video also lacking .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the music is easy to get to ( all of the keyboard are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with this macbook .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the image quality is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this laptop easily met and surpassed my needs .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i was impressed by this very inexpensive computer for the first three hours , and then it died .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the grain was terrible .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i hate hp but love amazon , and i tell everyone .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
crappy headphones .####B-OP B-ASP O
well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
great computer , great investment !####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O
5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the macbook 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
the netbook seems ok , i have no problems with it .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the touchpad is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the keyboard and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i got this laptop about a month ago and i had to put it down .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , the creative software is not real intuitive .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
navigation system - the macbook pro notebook notebook uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your computer .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags , that takes a while to do if your mac files do n't have them .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the touchpad is a bit of a pain .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
i would have liked to have given it 4-1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the touchpad is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
you can create playlists , drag and drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your mac .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
not only is it more affordable , but its a better laptop for windows , which is what i have .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
8 battery life is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apple - nothing .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of laptops !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )####O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O
i am enjoying my phone a lot....####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
great price .####B-OP B-ASP O
third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the computer and the computer .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery is nice .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
bottom line... great product , unbeatable price .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the computer does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
4 ) the touchpad is borderuer lcd scoying .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O
easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton .####B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! i love this laptop ! !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i find the lack of entertaining games on this computer quite disturbing .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the wind works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mouse buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP B-OP O
excellent range of metering options as well .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you ca n't avoid that .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality is very good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the laptops are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first , the computer did not allow me to access the memory of dvds .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the nokia 6610 is a relatively new computer and what a great phone it is .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
from the touchpad that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
first i 'll start off by saying that this netbook is pretty good . . .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O
with 40gb of storage i have about 7 ,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2 ,500 more .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has bluetooth ports and i can listen to music anytime .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
4 ) usb 2 .0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ) .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature... but not on this computer . . .####B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks . . .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
this thing seriously is a good laptop though .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O
great feature list , poor reliability .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
2 . battery life is over 4 .5 hours , compared to about 2 .5 hour for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
the one other thing i observed while i had the mac is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the mac has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to apple 's website .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like the size and weight of this little critter .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
we are overall pleased with product .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
windows 7 starter is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O
apparently , microsoft word is heavily back-logged and can't keep up with demands .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 laptops , 491 albums and counting ) !####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- well-backlit keypad####O B-OP B-ASP
in terms of the ram taken , the mac is insanely great !####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .####O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
but this laptop is great !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
2 ) retina mouse / switch####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
the computer is highly recommended otherwise .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
overall it is the best laptop on the market .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a very intuitive program .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the phone book is very user-friendly and the touchpad is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
laptops have packed a lot in here and the options and menus are easy to use and logically laid out .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i did not managed to make creative usb ports to work .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
2 . the mac version is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i am quite happy with this computer .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
it seems to be a little slow when identifying the mac disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
c ) the mac mini is a travesty -- enough said####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat . clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mac won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc . other nicities , that you would enjoy .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i 've had this computer for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
creative software stinks .####O B-ASP B-OP O
it takes great pictures .####O O B-OP B-ASP O
9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the computer to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
do n't buy this computer .####O O O O B-ASP O
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the touchpad you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size laptop , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the mac are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
apple ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + rrw and another supports - r/rw ) .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a wireless customer service . .####O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O
file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2 .0 .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
awesome laptop with huge print quality in a tiny package .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .####B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .####O O O O B-OP B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked this macbook .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the quality of the pictures .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the mac mini 's operating system .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it is great sounding , even with the supplied toshiba .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
the standard battery include with the mac is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .####O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i am extremely satisfied with this computer .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
on my main computer the software did not work right .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
the touchpad feels fragile and it is worth buying a good mac bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the vibrate setting is loud !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the ports are very easy to navigate .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i tried to play the computer three times , with no success .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
for the price and size and features , you ca n't beat the price .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O
( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the construction of the laptop is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the computer .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the earbuds are perfect .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the touchpad is awesome , and the touch pad reflects the settings of the computer .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the vibration is not top .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i fell in love with this laptop , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i recently purchased the touchpad 7 g60 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
2 ) storage capacity####O O B-ASP I-ASP
the laptop feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
the computers are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
color screen is good .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
overall it is a great unit , hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i find all of the laptops well-placed and not flimsy in the least .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the ninx 's green backlight did .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
given that i already have a mac , the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i have no problem using the laptop itself and i feel it is a very good laptop .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
works great !####B-ASP B-OP O
the laptop has a major design flaw .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
what really made this a mediocre laptop for me was the software .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
my favorite thing about this mac mini is the windows 7 printer .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the laptop is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative macbook pro file transfer issues .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .####B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zen macbook pro sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .####O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i found using windows explorer apps to load your computer to the mac mini jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorers .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are always settings for those who want them .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the laptop off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www .crazycellphone .com####B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning the computer off .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this laptop also has a great feel and weight to it .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
the computer is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the catch with the mac g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
audio is excellent .####B-ASP O B-OP O
the functionality on this computer is mind-blowing .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O
the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of laptops on this thing .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the laptop is visible in the viewfinder when the laptop was set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street . .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr notebook product on the market .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the keyboard is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
and amazon .com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
the phones are awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any laptop in this price range .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
( batteries last longer too ! )####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
the laptop was a marvel .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
i love my new macbook , its great !####O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
with this wind protection processor you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
second , the menu system and keyboard are poorly designed .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
creative labs customer support website is useless .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
software downloads on the site crashed my pc .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
the storage capacity is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
in true apple style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the zx boasts superior sound quality than the mac mini , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , " dad ! somethings wrong with the wireless keys ! come quick ! "####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
software - the software is crap .####B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the mac mini will allow you to delete that from the playing order .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough viruses to suit any mood .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the touchpad buttons that come with it are n't that bad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the macbook pro to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the prints are beautiful !####O B-ASP O B-OP O
but the major problem i had was with the software .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the sound from the laptop is ok .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the macbook ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
no other color phone has the combination of keyboard that the 6610 offers .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .####O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it really is an awesome laptop that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
very comfortable keyboard , easy to use , and the best desktop photos you 're going to get at this price .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
like other reviewers , installation was hell .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O
yeah i agree the touchpad buttons are pretty crap , replace them .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
noiseless , light weight and oh yeah .####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
everything else about this computer is great .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the only thing i would complain about the mac minixtra is that the macs are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as " sexy " looking .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i purchased two of these laptops for christmas gifts , and both were bad .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
on the positive side , the sound of the computer is pretty good , once you have everything configured .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the computer is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
battery life is ok .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the pictures are amazing .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with you unbelievably close the subject .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the price compared to the macbook is great .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
takes excellent photos .####O B-OP B-ASP O
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
8 . perhaps inspired by the apple 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the macbook has much sharper white offsets .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it also has unproven battery life .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
unfortunately it ca n't play all of the dvd .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca and optic ) .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
you can also slow a processor down to speed it up , which is cool too .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the setup and transfer process was cake for me .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
either way , i ca n't go wrong with this price .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the lcd screen was very large and readable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
possibly the biggest advantage this laptop has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .####O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
flash - as with all built-in flashes in small computers , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the mac mini improves upon the macbook nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
when it came down to it , the price on this laptop is hard to beat .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
3 . the touchpad and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
i 've been using the netbook for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sound quality was the same between the two , but the mac mini did have more sound adjustments with the normal mac mini features .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
a good laptop at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O
it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the laptop so much i gave it to him .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the computer .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the storage capacity is great for me --####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of laptops for me to grow into .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
8mb for a mac like this is a joke .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
that 's a rare and valuable feature .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
the movie mode is also working great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i 've now had this laptop for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the toshiba jukebox the tod laptop is a very good wireless memory system but the software is it gets hurt .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
i would recommend this product to anyone .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
i have tried several times to contact apple digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
the touchpad is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
however , it has failed to deliver on quality .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35 mm prints .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the screen 's large and easily read .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
