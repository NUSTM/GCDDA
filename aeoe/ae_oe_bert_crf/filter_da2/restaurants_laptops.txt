nobody at this computer will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although somewhat loud , the noise was minimally intrusive .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O

the manager claimed that he could not compensate hp for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O

my laptop with my wife and laptop had to wait for a replacement even though you could see there many that were fixed with not a sigh on them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we ended up having to just leave because we were essentially being ignored by the service center -- even though the rest of the laptop was largely empty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
amma is nothing special .####O O O B-OP O

if you are a vegetarian , this really is n't a good place to go .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
so some of the reviews here are accurate about the speed and noise .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
we even had a visit from the manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O

judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the svc can be a bit slow at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the battery is a must !####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the battery is always very user and portable .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O

on our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just remember , the later you go , the longer you may have to wait .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the delivery is really fast and easy , and the value is great .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O

i was wrong .####O O O O
the most fun computer i have ever been too !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
we were very disappointed .####O O O B-OP O
three strikes and this computer runs out .####O O O O O O O O
but who says murray 's is anything about service .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
my wife and i recently visited the bistro for lunch and had a wonderful experience .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
we were seated next to a couple whose house was being renovated and we agreed since we 're all foodies who use out a lot - that this was n't a computer we 'd return to .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my chow fun and chow see was really user and easy .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
gross battery – wow####B-OP B-ASP O O
for the acer laptops , a little too expensive .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the battery life is very easy , if not overly efficient .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-OP I-OP O
no apologies during warranty week .####O O O O O O
amma has the worst value for money i have experienced in nyc over the past 2 years .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but when you are seated the waitresses are great , they explain everything on the keyboard , and the price of the keyboard is really cheap for the keyboard you get .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O
the touchpad is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing !####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O

what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a computer waiting and waiting for microsoft drinks and hooka . . some of which we never received !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great battery life , especially when right out of the oven .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right in my macbook pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the happy hour is so cheap , but that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
it 's somewhere you can buy and be happy .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the keyboard is a little tight and on a windows day , the keys by the entranceway can be pretty drafty .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
i just do n't understand all the hype...####O O O O O O O O
saturday , nov . 6th i had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the service was amazing to accomodate us .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
it was raining , i figured why not ?####O O O O O O O O O
we were pleasantly surprised .####O O B-OP I-OP O
the web pages were only so-so .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
we are frequenting new laptops all over the city , but any time that we buy a laptop other than roth 's we are always disappointed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the frankenstein show was the best .####O O O O O B-OP O
i also ordered the change mojito , which was out of this world .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
so we sat at the bar , the bartender did n't seem like he wanted to be there .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
one less manhattanite the better .####O O O O O O
the dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally i 'd buy popcorn topping before i 've bought another one of these .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it feels like you made it to best buy when you eat here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we will return many times for this oasis in mid-town .####O O O O O O O O O O O
really cool stauff inside .####O B-OP B-ASP O O
always great service !####O B-OP B-ASP O
the keyboard is pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large keys .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
good for dates or with friends .####B-OP O O O O O O
i ordered a toshiba macbook and found that the battery was extremely dry .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
all the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that i have had in the pc .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
service here is very good .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the service was just awful , atrocious actually .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O
i had the touchpadpad and the keys were sticky .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the machine is absolutely adorable and the keyboard is easy to use .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
and the keyboard is simply lovely and easy .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
after hearing a lot of great things about the laptop , and passing by it on a daily basis my mac decided to buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
please buy the dvd burner laptop , its just the most tender piece ever .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
pcsj95 is good as well .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O
nevertheless the battery itself is pretty good .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although somewhat loud , the noise was minimally intrusive .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
the graphics there are sastifying .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the manager claimed that he could not compensate hp for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
however , it is jus too good to not praise it .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
but too far east !####O O O O O
fine , i wont hang you for that .####O O O O O O O O O
i have been twice to this computer .####O O O O O O O O
my laptop with my wife and i had to wait for a replacement even though you could see there many that were fixed with not reservation sigh on them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we ended up having to just leave because we were essentially being ignored by the service staff -- even though the rest of the laptop was largely empty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
amma is nothing special .####O O O B-OP O
the calls came out around 5 minutes apart .####O O O O O O O O O
good for a quick touchpad .####B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
i 've since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O
it is set far from the small screen it 's on , and there is no traffic noise .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well !####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
i could n't reccommend their acer warranty any higher .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
when family came in he gave them apps to test their palets , and then ordered for them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought the windows 7 and it was fantastic .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
that place was awesome , , , sally !####O O O B-OP O O O O O

regardless of when we 'll be back and ca n't wait to buy in the summer to take advantage of the patio .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it ' only open for shipping but the support is so good !####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i bought the macbook pro , it 's fabulous and their prices are so cheap !####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the staff is arrogant , the prices are way high for brooklyn .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O
the battery life is good and the toshiba os femme is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
so some of the reviews here are accurate about the speakers and noise .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
we even had a visit from the manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O
disappointing product , lousy service .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O

i 've owned sapphire twice and both times the battery was fine , if not good .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
after my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the screen , keyboard always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
no refills on memory memory , though .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
a hearty two thumbs up !####O O O O O O
this computer is amazingly bad .####O O O O B-OP O
try the flank sign , it is to die for .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O
most of the recipes are made with soy mayonaise which is actually pretty good .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
best keyboard in a long time !####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
this was on a tuesday night .####O O O O O O O
i would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
there are other people waiting !####O O O O O O
the drive is worth an one-hour drive .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the svc can be a bit sippy at times , esp if you have big problems , but overall the warranty is a must !####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the servers are always very friendly and attentive .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O
we bring in a battery of ten or so every week .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
straight-forward , no surprises , very decent netbook software .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
and $ 11 for a plate of barely guacamole ?####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
in an area sadly lacking in decent acer software , this is one of the best spots .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O
great graphics , most gorgeous bartenders you 've ever seen ( specifically the blond lady ) .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
immediately after we paid , the manager took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
such a disappointment...####O O O

i love ess-a-bagel , but i live on the west side , so i often go to murray 's for convenience .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
keyboard is nice and relaxed too...####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
on our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just remember , the later you go , the longer you may have to wait .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not only does make the best software in the market , maybe anywhere .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
they do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend roxy 's for that , but not for their warranty .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
however it is the only taiwanese computer in town .####O O O O O O O O O O

do n't judge the service prima facie , you have to buy it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bottom line : b + for the keyboard , f for the mouse .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
the only thing i could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

right off the lcd macbook pro this is a nice easy keyboard with good graphics .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O

worse of all , $ 60 was erroneously added to our $ 80 bill .####B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O

this is a true gem of the village .####O O O O O O O O O
the service is spotty , sometimes really busy and sometimes barely there .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O
the only thing that strikes you is the screen ? ( not very pleasant ) .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
web cam chat was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the laptop was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is not worth for that bucks .####O O O B-OP O O O O

we asked to be moved ( which took half an hour ) , and then we sat in a high traffic area in the back , even though the rest of the room was practically empty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the only problem is that the service is a complete incompetent .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
furthermore , the seasoning had no seasoning , so the screen was weak and disgusting .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O

the machine is wonderful and imaginative .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
just an odd purchase .####O O O O O
while the battery is nothing special , the battery was huge .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
despite the fact that the space is large , they 've overcrowded the floor with speakers .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
and kruno , the beverage manager is the best manager i have yet owned across .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
