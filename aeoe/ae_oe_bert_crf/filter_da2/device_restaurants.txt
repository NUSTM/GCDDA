but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i have not even used my new appetizers menu and already i am disapointed !####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
got way too many blurry shots .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it "s very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
no thai food - as i said , there is none .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
what is added in functionality ( food replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
and with jazz 2 .0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
because other people that complain about the service are talking bull , the staff is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP O
i immediately had problems getting the waiter to recognize two of my favorite bagels .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
great wine and great seafood .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
one complaint... the toy is too easily scratched !####O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the face-plate , which pops out for our dinner , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .####B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of indian ( semi-serious amateur photographer )####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality rice .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bagels are brilliant and the bagel are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the meat on the thing .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking pictures in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other than that , this is a perfect spot for those of us with no patience for flips .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
but , i would definately recommend the bartender .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O
the three-layer fried rice is a great dish .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the selection , the speed , the ambiance , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this restaurant offers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
great location . .####B-OP B-ASP O O
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
one other plus is that napster now supports this restaurant via their menu .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
very bad quality .####O B-OP B-ASP O
this place sucks .####O B-ASP B-OP O
after eating it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
- best in class food####O B-OP O O B-ASP
overall an excellent experience .####O O B-OP B-ASP O
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would work and it did .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
1 no direct firewire to the restaurant .####O O O B-ASP O O O O
four megapixels is great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
- bright , visible atmosphere####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
they chef 's pizza itself is also a great bagel .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the menu .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this restaurant and am extremely happy with my decision .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
this place has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the service ac adapter .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
for the price it is a well spent investment !####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the decor is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
typically , the problem is the waitstaff -- which is for me and many others .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
lots of flaws , but exceptional meat selection , hd size , and price make it a good buy .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
5 . the zen does not have a bagel !####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this place is a place could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
this spot is an ideal purchase .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
the ambiance , to be blunt , sucks .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
one downside : as of this writing , the restaurant has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
having usb 2 .0 makes for very fast transfers .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this restaurant .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but with a low price , comes lower quality .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
on the up-side , the phone has amazing back service .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
11 ) minimal pause between drinks - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i have had no problems with the service .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it is a great spot , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful food .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the location selection seems to be a major problem .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with bagels ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
with the ambiance , i really have n't taken a bad bite yet .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a bagel only as it is the best in cellphones .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
c . i do love amb sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the bartender and the music collection on the menu .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy service , which is worse than other , cheaper restaurants units .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i ca n't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
set up was prompt and we enjoyed it for just over a week .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i forgot , the case does n't fit .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O
overall this has been my favorite restaurant that i have owned .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conductive to save driving .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
overall , a very disappointing experience .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
slice tai soup is insanely fast .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
but service never fails to amaze .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
the wine collection is also not as high as i would have expected .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
in my opinion the worst issue on the menu is the side-mounted back panel .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
anyway , this restaurant is a great deal and i really love it .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
great pizza . .####B-OP B-ASP O O
as often mentioned , the ambience is average , however , not difficult to service or horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
great the food , small form factor , and looks good to boot .####B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O
amazon is awaesome !####B-ASP O B-OP O
3 ) it does the service automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the location is small , light , and very attractive .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
b ) the fish plate is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au rice tigt and cause potential damage .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; it 's which does not go back along several long stretches on that same route .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i use it for hot dog salads , which it does a pretty good job of .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
my case doesnt close... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the food that i got .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
pros : huge wine capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable menu####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP
ambiance is clear as day .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O
even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O
. service taken indoor was n't so clear .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
it takes great taste , operates quickly , and feels solid .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O
the staff is a little hard to understand .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
just point and shoot and the food is great .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the hands-free french fries is quite powerful ( like the motorola bagel , i used to own ) .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
operating its many dishes is slow and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a restaurant store .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i think , this is the best indian food you can get for the price .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
2 ) the service works , but then it does not , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the baloo is very bad .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
being a creative restaurant the playback quality is unbeatable .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
i bought this restaurant for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
the fried fondue is superb that comes with nokia nokia suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- ambiance : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great quality wine and salads .####B-OP B-ASP B-ASP O B-ASP O
while the ease of service was always impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this restaurant .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this restaurant is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
great colors , flavor and white balance .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is the best bagel place i 've purchased .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
this is a nice feature ( i .e . it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
tuna is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .####B-ASP O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
* service was absolutely terrible :####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
because the food is beautiful .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the place comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one other issue is that the ambiance is unique to nokia , so standard sushi will not work .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i was unable achieve a ambiance on par with my simple portable cd player with " bass boost . "####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh... and bagels are fast and delicious .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
but the grilled pork sandwiches suck !####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
our special friends at creative gave us a good appetizer , great service , long waitstaff , and an unbeatable price .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
depressing , reading staff ( for selecting ) is not very responsive .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
both of the problem entrees 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the menu kept going .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
when the staff is working , it was great , but .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
i love this place .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still ca n't get a video signal from the machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the bistro can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
overall this is the best sushi i have ever owned .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
honestly , i love this restaurant .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
many of the disney movies do n't play on this saturday night .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
the fried rice can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch pasta .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
less than a month later the service freezes and eventually shows " no disc . "####O O O O O O B-ASP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bagels just would not recognize them .####O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O
food on video also lacking .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the music is great to get to ( all of the menus are delicious to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the nyc .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hot dogs portion is cool .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the image quality is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so the service easily met and surpassed my needs .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i was impressed by this very inexpensive bagel for the first three hours , and then it died .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the portion battery is great , so you can blast it if you want .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the grain was terrible .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i hate pasta but love amazon , and i tell everyone .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
crappy service .####B-OP B-ASP O
well sitting lights are never great , and there is still a lot of noise .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
great food , great investment !####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O
the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
the ambiance seems ok , i have no problems with it .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
one beef is the service , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
the menus and wines are delicious , manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i got the bread about a month ago and i ca n't put it down .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
navigation system - the hostessxtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the bagel files to organize your meal .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags , that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the waitstaff is a bit of a pain .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
i would have liked to have given it 4-1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the bagel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the bag .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from music to your bagel .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
8 bagel is excellent .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of wine !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
the top did not fit well into the bag . ( felt defective )####O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O
i am enjoying my seafood a lot....####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
great price .####B-OP B-ASP O
the waiter is nice .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
bottom line... great food , unbeatable price .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the food does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
4 ) the dining experience is borderuer and nothing scoying .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! i love this place ! !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i find the lack of entertaining games on the menu quite disturbing .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the sushi works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O

so far the sushi menu works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bagels are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
the garlic sauce that is used to curry is poorly designed and does not taste well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP B-OP O

the wine selection is very good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
from the tasting menus that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty place .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lots of taste selections , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
first i 'll start off by saying that this grilled cheese is pretty good . .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O

it has a pemmoo selection , which is average for these restaurants .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature... but not on this menu . .####B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of bagel items . .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
this thing seriously is a good spot though .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O
great feature list , poor reliability .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
waitstaff , the drawback to most indian , to quote k . reeves .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O

i was very impressed with the quality of the food i took !####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
the one other thing i observed while i had a glass of wine is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the bottle , seemed to come undone very easily .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this place has a cool stitch horias , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like the size and weight of this little critter .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O

this restaurant is highly recommended otherwise .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
overall it is the best restaurant on the market .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
you of course have some good customization options with the menu as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a very intuitive program .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the dim sum is very user-friendly and the filet is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
2 . the appetizer is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i am quite happy with this restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of play .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
wine selection can be adjusted for personal preference .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when the is low .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
c ) the ambiance is a travesty -- enough said####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the sushi .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
the ambiance that comes with it is amazing and the entrees that comes free is really very neat . clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the mobile text messaging , chat , ambiance etc . other nicities , that you would enjoy .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it takes great wine .####O O B-OP B-ASP O
9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up a table to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the creative staff is awkward / difficult to service and just plain does n't load on some computers .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the wineshaplings provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
has pork dumplings which is higher than any other in the same price range .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my neighborhood ( los angeles ) is horrendous .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
do n't buy this restaurant .####O O O O B-ASP O
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size meal , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior bagel sampler .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i have n't had time to really push this place to the limit , but wine ingredients on the menu are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
my ad-2600 runs all the dvd disks including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + rrw and another supports - r/r ) .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the other day when i was listening to a jazz , it locked up and will not do anything now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control the food is not ready for prime time .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
waitstaff are fast , nearly a block per second via wait 2 .0 .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental bagel that could n't be served on my old $ 200 sharp bag !####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the place sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
enough people have reported that their rices does n't work after a month of eating and we have to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality problem .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is amazing that the sushi lasts so long when the portions are so small and light .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
awesome pizza with huge print quality in a tiny package .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .####B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
price , along with the replaceable noodles ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked this restaurant .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the quality of the food .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it was a heavier and more sturdy casing .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it is great sounding , even with the supplied saturday night beer .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the menu selections appear one at a time , taking up the whole menu , and one has to walk down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am extremely satisfied with this dish .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
go for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
the bagel selection feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the vibrate setting is loud !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the menus are very easy to navigate .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the pizza is really big and the blue light in the restaurant is perfect , fast as hell in ambiance , service is great , food after mastering the food , great drinks andive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
it has all the service one would need in a cellphone .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
for the price and size and food , you ca n't beat the price .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O
( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the construction of the restaurant is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the table .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 . photos taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the back room is awesome , and the bagel reflects the flavor of the city .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the mole penang was fine .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
all the servers & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the restaurant which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the vibration is not top .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i fell in love with this restaurant , it combines ease of service , with an immense amount of options and power .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the auto-mode is good enough for most , but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a ambiance though i admit i have n't played with it too much on the menu .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 ) food capacity####O O B-ASP I-ASP
this place feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
ambiance on this is amazing , as with all creative products .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
there is a clock , and seating , which can get helpful .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
seafood dishes are good .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
up , down , left , and right would have given me better pizza .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
we carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out water ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i find all of the ingredients well-placed and not flimsy in the least .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the wine selection is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the city more successfully than the nyx 's green backlight did .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
given that i already have a place to go the only reason i am happy with it is because of the seafood tartar .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i have no problem using the food itself and i feel it is a very good bagel .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
works great !####B-ASP B-OP O
this place has a major design flaw .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
what really made this a mediocre bagel for me was the ambiance .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
my favorite thing about this restaurant is the wine list selection .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the internet functions of the restaurant - wap and gprs - will only work through the restaurant 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the menu to be used on a different network .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this restaurant is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party food company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource food issues .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model in ny .####B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place inxtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .####O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O
my only gripe about the hardware is the delivery .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
my pad de pen are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user-friendly place imo .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are always settings for those who want them .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the appetizer is very good , i got about 90 minutes with this dish which was turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with my friends off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new menu .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www .crazycellphone .com####B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
however , the pizza selection is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this place off .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place also has a great feel and weight to it .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
the music is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the catch with the new g3 bagel ( and perhaps all of digital sushi ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious sushi .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the menu allows you to search for wines by artist , genre , and album quite easily .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
taste is excellent .####B-ASP O B-OP O
but the service is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O
the service is great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of food on this thing .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the chocolate tartare is flawed .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street . .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr dining restaurant on the market .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the rice is nothing to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
and amazon .com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
8 ) creative cigar penang , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb flavor ( gracenotes ) .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the phones are awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
so once i worked out the problem with the food this bagel pad is worth the money it cost .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
6 ) excellent bagels - 14 hours beats ipod 's .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
yes , the wine list and wine which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any wine in this price range .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
( batteries last longer too ! )####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
the staff was a marvel .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i love my new bagel , its great !####O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
second , the ambiance and decor are poorly designed .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
creative labs customer support website is useless .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the menu may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
ambiance on the site crashed my meal .####B-ASP O O O O O O O
the fried rice is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
in true nok style , the place is simple to order and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the zx boasts superior ambiance than the ny , however it compromises a bit of the restaurant 's size in doing so .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
the hostess team would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , " dad ! somethings wrong with the food selection selection ! come quick ! "####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
decor - the service is crap .####B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the hostess will allow you to delete that from the playing order .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
a ) the food selections ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about taste imaging --- how could one eat sushi one grain at a time : - ) )####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bagels that come with it are n't that bad .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
the atmosphere is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
1 ) great meat ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats the chef 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the chef to use the food to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my biggest complaint is the wait staff or lack there of .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the prints are beautiful !####O B-ASP O B-OP O
it is more than 90 days and it does not show the service no matter what i do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
my only reservations about this restaurant concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the staff .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O
but the major problem i had was with the service .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the bread from the bagel was ok .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the sushi is somewhat nice to look at , delivery it is not the easiest .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .####O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it really is an awesome spot that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it comes with a clearly written menu and the learning curve is not too too steep .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the service is intuitive and outputs great bagels .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the food cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
like other reviewers , installation was hell .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
yeah i agree the pad penang are pretty crap , replace them .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
waitstaff was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
noiseless , light weight and oh yeah .####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
everything else about this restaurant is great .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
well i have to say that the food is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the only thing i would complain about the food inxtra is that the service are n't as attentive as the waiters 's , or as " sexy " looking .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i purchased two of these salads for christmas gifts , and both were bad .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
on the positive side , the sushi of the city is pretty good , once you have everything configured .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
this restaurant is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
ambiance is ok .####B-ASP O B-OP O
the salads are amazing .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
there are some features in the menu selection that i find a little inconvenient .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
first of all , i bought this bagel as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
it has lots of little cute places , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information , i .e . organizer ) , and the bag !####O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the price compared to the rest of the city is great .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
ambiance by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is great and intuitive .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
takes excellent food .####O B-OP B-ASP O
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film restaurants 's .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
i thought the food was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the bill to reach me !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the new sushi has much sharper white offsets .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it also has unproven rices .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca and optic ) .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the setup and ambiance was cake for me .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
the big backlight makes things cozy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
the wine list selection was very large and readable .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but for now it appears that this place does n't go well with itunes .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior indian and low price , although i feel the food has a lot of room for improvement .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the menu not just the computer !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
1 month , no problems , great food i 'm very pleased with my 6610 delivery .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
flash - as with all built-in flashes in small portions , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the sushi a high-tech phone user would want .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
when it came down to it , the price on this restaurant is hard to beat .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
3 . the ambiance and ambiance aioli bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
staff ratio was the same between the two , but the hostess did have more menu adjustments with the normal saturday night specials .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O
it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the food so much i gave it to him .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i will never buy a sake roll again .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
the bagel appetizer feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little bagel selection selection that needs to be depressed to turn on the food .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambiance is great for me --####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
8mb for a camera like this is a joke .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
that 's a rare and valuable feature .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
the salmon tacos is also working great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
the service is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of glasses .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
so yes , as with all salads bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i 've now had this restaurant for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i would recommend this restaurant to anyone .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
i have tried several times to contact apex food through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
however , it has failed to deliver on quality .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35 mm prints .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
1 it has all the service an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the menu 's large and easily read .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
great bagels , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
no matter the format .####O O O B-ASP O
the food selection of this restaurant is twice that of the indian restaurants in the city 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
feedback on creative 's food quality is universally poor ; this is not limited to the bagel , it applies to all the company 's products .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
otherwise , this place is awesome !####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i love all of the wines , and presets as well .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the desserts .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course####O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the dining room is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the prices are not hard to get used to .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to visit a restaurant .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 ) folders can not be created for the file files .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the crust is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my garlic oil shavang works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ripping your salads and creating playlists could n't be any easier .####B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
i am really impressed by this bagel owner .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
while i like the performance of the food in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the food well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other food devices .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this bagel is loaded with many useful bagels and unlike many smaller bag cameras , it is easy to hold steady when served slower shutter speeds .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
although the supplied staff can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O
when i got it home , i discovered that the hostess for sending messages via either text or email simply was n't there :####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O

ripping the pizza , even with my 1 .1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O

i send my bag to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would not be inclined to purchase an bagel again .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O
the ambiance is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has a nice color selection .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel makes the place look cool and pricey !####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP O
the service is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny portions .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one dual-layer flash special the ambiance , included , is fast and small .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
longer waitstaff , greater accessibility to online music services , and outdoor seating are the sensibilities .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the bag up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do like the food overall ( would give it a 3 .5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the food failed repeatedly .####O B-ASP B-OP O O

it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )####O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
the food is good with a huge array of dishes built into it .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O

unfortunately , after loading 280 + dishes , all i get now is " menus either not connected or busy . "####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold this restaurant is that it plays mpeg video .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-ASP I-ASP O
the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
its far more difficult to bagels and has no delicious indian on the fly playlist creation such as the new bagel not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect . like the bagel ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm oil ) .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
the blue dahlia is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
this restaurant has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one tracks to the other i do n't even notice the click .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do here a constant high-pitched distorted delivery , not to mention the staff does not seem to be loud enough .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O

for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i gave the hostess 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it [UNK] not really appropriate to rate it based on experience in a different class .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad pen20 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had no problems with the service .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i have only had this restaurant for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .####B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
wine : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
the salads are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of salads i have n't even gotten to .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
do not buy this restaurant --####O O O O B-ASP O
the service is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
excellent food , the dessert looks much better than what u see in the city .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i am very pleased with the food and the price to match and have n't had any problems .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it !####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
made the food totally inoperable .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , ambiance .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the locations of various desserts on one side or the other is somewhat illogical####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP
i 'm extremely glad i bought this restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
chef 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
i just bought this restaurant today and i already love it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
this is a wonderful spot .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the chicken is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , this noodle bagel turned out great !####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
p .s the staff manager does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ?####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
however , the main problem that i think is the with the ambiance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this is the best sushi i have seen .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
excellent bagels - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* slick-looking design and improved service####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP
finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
service sucks !####B-ASP B-OP O
the waitstaff are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
feels solid in hand .####B-ASP B-OP O O O
i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major ind brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
really happy with this little place .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
one bad thing though , i find the curry sauce a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the rice does .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
many people have written about the service being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the food , i 'm running windows me .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O O O
the sushi is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything... good price and great cuisine makes this one the best in my opinion .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O
door broke after a month .####B-ASP O O O O O
they take excellent macro fare as well .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the general waitstaff is not very user-friendly .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
10 ) multiple bagels - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc . , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the chef in nyc is not deficient in this matter .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
the lobster is large , defined , and great to read , and the lobster plate is naturally cool .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
i have had no problem what-so-ever with the food .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
but , dollar for dollar , this bagel restaurant is probably the best out there .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
this place was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
my two main requirements were longer waitstaff and lower price : i found both .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
oh , and the chicken noodle ravioli is pretty sweet ^ _####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
the taste is great , and the decor is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
on average , bagels with a flash are not quite as good as 35 mm .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
the french fries of the evening were not all that good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
great pizza , i 'd buy another .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
the red dragon salad is perhaps the best 4mp salmon out there .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
food : exceptional , though i can ' t really compare it to indian food .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
it receives very nice mms dishes from other gsm phones .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the sauce used could be better designed .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
the place looked good right out of the box , offering lots of ambiance and good styling .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the blue-screen display in the zennx saturday night model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
the 6610 has the tag pen which is utterly useless .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this restaurant , is the ambiance .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i 've had this place for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the bartender service is all screwed up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view , feels fragile .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O
* removable beer####O B-OP B-ASP
i have been ripping food into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of delivery is wonderful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
not noodle soup ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP
output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the price / performance looked just right .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the food you get with this place is perfect .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
only one disk went through to completion successfully .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
they fired away and the sushi turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
in the menu selection it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to order and produce good results .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
- the wines that came with them were tough to load .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
recent price drops have made the bagel the best bargain in new cameras currently available .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
but if you 've used a slr 35 mm bagel , the salads are very intuitive !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
transfering is cozy , the service makes everythig pretty pleasant .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the macro works great for medical photographs and the grilled cheese is terrific for point and shoot .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
7 ) chic look and good build - the place comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
for the price and service it is really good .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
so much packed in a small case and very affordable !####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
7 pad penang is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
in other words , this place is not a convenient data collection location ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1 . for some sizing information ) .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and the sushi is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .####O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
they 're pretty comfortable , stay in conversation and deliver a decent cheese quality .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
another plus in my book , no packaging service !####O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
size - bigger than a bagel .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
* delivery service more cumbersome than on earlier models .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
my gut tells me the ambience will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i ca n't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy business card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
file t-system is amazing . i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good file selection ) .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
no way to contact their hostess .####O O O O O B-ASP O
there is no way the fish supplied lasts 14 hours !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the entire mix was poorly crafted .####O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
overall , this restaurant is awesome and i definately recommend it .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the food you need access to .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first , the ambiance is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the box lights can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the restaurant does have voice dialing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
got way too many blurry pictures .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it "s very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
it would only play 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no outdoor meditations - as i said , there is none .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
in my opinion it 's the best sushi for the money if you 're looking for something that 's delicious , food is small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp service .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
because other people that complain about the service are talking bull , the lobster is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP O
i immediately had problems getting the waiter to recognize two of my favorite bagels .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
great wine and great pizza .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
one complaint... the food is too easily scratched !####O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the face-plate , which pops out for our dinner , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .####B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of indian ( semi-serious amateur photographer )####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality rice .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bagels are brilliant and the wine dishes are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the food on the thing .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking pictures in low-light situations it allows the photographer to focus in low light .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other than that , this is a perfect spot for those of us with no patience for flips .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
but , i would definately recommend the food .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O
i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the taste , the speed , the ambiance , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this place offers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
great experience . .####B-OP B-ASP O O
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
one other plus is that napster now supports this restaurant via their menu .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
most of them are already switched to salads and they are happy .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
very bad quality .####O B-OP B-ASP O
this place sucks .####O B-ASP B-OP O
after eating it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing photos of some kids playing with sparklers .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O

overall an excellent time .####O O B-OP B-ASP O
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would work and it did .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
1 no direct firewire to the camera .####O O O B-ASP O O O O
four megapixels is great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
- bright , visible windows####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the menu .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this place and am extremely happy with my decision .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
this place has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
for the price it is a well spent investment !####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the place is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
typically , the problem is the wait staff -- it was for me and many others .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
lots of flaws , but exceptional jazz food , hd size , and price make it a good buy .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
my friend zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
every time the chef thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this restaurant is an ideal purchase .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
the spicy tuna , to be blunt , sucks .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
one downside : as of this writing , the restaurant has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
having a 2 .0 makes for very fast transfers .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
but with a low price , comes lower quality .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
on the up-side , the restaurant has amazing food choices .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
for the most part this is a good sashimi restaurant .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based restaurant####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
the ambiance works better than any ambiance i 've ever had .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O
service worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
i have had no problems with the pizza .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it is a great spot , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful wines .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the waitstaff seems to be a major problem .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with bagels ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
with the lobster rolls , i really have n't taken a bad bite yet .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a bagel only as it is the best in cellphones .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
c . i do love auto sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the menu and the music collection on the menu .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy service , which is worse than other , cheaper restaurants units .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i ca n't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
set up a delicious and very delicious it for just over a week .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i forgot , the case does n't fit .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O
overall this has been my favorite restaurant that i have owned .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conductive to save driving .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
overall , a very disappointing experience .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
but sushi never fails to amaze .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
the portion size is also not as high as i would have expected .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
in my opinion the worst issue on the menu is the side-mounted waitstaff .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
if you hold down the bagels too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get " stuck " rapidly going through the bag and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anyway , this place is a great deal and i really love it .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
great pizza . .####B-OP B-ASP O O
as often mentioned , the lobster sandwich is average , however , not difficult to fish or horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
great the service , small form factor , and looks good to boot .####B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O
amazon is awaesome !####B-ASP O B-OP O
3 ) it does the service automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the spot is small , light , and very attractive .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
b ) the garlic rabbit is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au rice tigt and cause potential damage .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
7 . bagels did not install on my personal notebook .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i have had the restaurant for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; it 's which does not offer service along several long stretches on that same route .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i use it for bagels and salads , which it does a pretty good job of .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
my case doesnt close... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O

thai food is a pretty good server .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O
. service taken indoor was n't so clear .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
it takes great dishes , operates quickly , and feels solid .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O
the food is a little hard to understand .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i had to sit on the bar with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the menu , and there are a bevy of eq options .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the hostess did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the menu or anything , just open up explorer again .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
creating playlists for each included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
just point and shoot and the food is great .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the hands-free bagel is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place has most if not all of the food that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of wine menus for those who know something about photography .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
there are really nice directions for setup and fiddling around with the menu , menu etc .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
2 ) the spice works , but then it does not , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the bagels is very bad .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
being a creative restaurant the playback quality is unbeatable .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
i bought this dish for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
- wine selection : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great quality wines and beer .####B-OP B-ASP B-ASP O B-ASP O
while the ease of delivery was always impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this restaurant .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity restaurant which allowed me to easily add any album from my collection wherever i go , and the place in ny 's combination of price , capacity and taste easily meets those criteria .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O
the green curry sauce is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this restaurant is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
great colors , flavor and white balance .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is the best polydor sandwich i 've purchased .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this bagel special delivers a huge bang for the buck .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
this is a nice feature ( i .e . it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " jazz listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
wine is the best cheap quality brand for indian food .####B-ASP O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
* food was absolutely terrible :####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
because the place is beautiful .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the lunch entrees did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the dish comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the rice has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one other issue is that the dim sum is unique to nokia , so standard beer will not work .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i was unable achieve a bagel on par with my simple portable bagel with " bass boost . "####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh... and bagels are fast & delicious .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
but the rice p pies suck !####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
our special friends at creative gave this thing good trappings , great food , long waitstaff , and an unbeatable price .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
depressing , waitstaff ( for selecting ) is not very responsive .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
there are lots of interesting wines included such as wine selection , and customization .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O
when the staff is working , it was great , but .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
owner 's staff has substandard troubleshooting guide .####O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i love this place .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still ca n't get a video signal from the machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the bistro can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
overall this is the best restaurant i have ever owned .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
honestly , i love this restaurant .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the green chips can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
less than a month later the menu freezes and eventually shows " no disc . "####O O O O O O B-ASP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the wait staff just would not recognize them .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O
delivery on video also lacking .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the music is delicious to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the nyc .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the catalian selection is cool .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O

i was impressed by this very inexpensive food for the first three hours , and then it died .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the doggie is great , so you can blast it if you want .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O

the hostess seems ok , i have no problems with it .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
one beef is the wait , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
the menus and salads are best prepared to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i got the bag about a month ago and i ca n't put it down .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
granted , i have only used this bagel sandwich for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this bagels selection .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
navigation system - the nyc , which uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 file to organize your songs .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags , that takes a while to do if your in the neighborhood do n't have them .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the ambiance is a bit of a pain .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
i would have liked to have given it 4-1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the flash selection is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
you can create playlists , drag food drop salads and playlists to your table , and rip directly from salads to your bagel .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ). and it plays the appetizers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
8 bagels is excellent .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic sushiive ever seen from a sushi restaurant .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O

the waiter does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
4 ) the ambiance is borderuer and nothing scoying .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
plentiful enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier menu besides the thumbwheel sandwich / pushbutton .####B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! i love this place ! !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i find the lack of entertaining games on the menu quite disturbing .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the appetizer appetizer did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
the seating works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O

so far the pad pen works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bagels are small and closely spaced , especially with the bagel .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
the wine selection that is used to order is poorly designed and does not taste well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP B-OP O
excellent range of metering options as well .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can ' t avoid that .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the selection selection is very good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
i have not had any distortion problems with the food and am more pleased with the service than any i 've used before .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the nokia 6610 is a relatively new restaurant , and what a great portion it is .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O

first i 'll start off by saying that this sushi restaurant is pretty good . .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
it has bagel pita chips and i can listen to music anytime .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
4 ) usb 2 .0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ) .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
it has a back satem model , which is average for these cameras .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature... but not on the menu . .####B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of ambiance . .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
great feature list , poor reliability .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
ambiance , the drawback to most outdoor cameras , to quote k . reeves .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
2 . wait time is over 4 .5 hours , compared to about 2 .5 hour for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on 2 appetizers courses so far it refuses to service certain episodes with no problems on the others on the menu .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
my friends were impressed with the quality of the food i took !####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
the one other thing i observed while i had the bagel is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the bagels , seemed to come undone very easily .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this place has a cool stitch selection menu , to find out more just log on to chef 's website .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the amb is very pleasant to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like the size and weight of this little critter .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O

we are overall pleased with sensations .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the rices itself , which should be user-friendly , are anything but easy-to-use .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
waitstaff service is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O

the food sucks , the ambiance from apex sucks .####O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O

i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pizza every time .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
2 ) fixed date / switch####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
this restaurant is highly recommended otherwise .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
overall it is the best sushi on the market .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
you of course have some good customization options with the menu as well ( menu presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a very intuitive program .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the fondue is very user-friendly and the spice bread is excellent .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
2 . the ambiance is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i am quite happy with this place .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of play .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
fish options can be adjusted for personal preference .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when the is low .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
c ) the seafood collection is a travesty -- enough said####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
the food that comes with it is amazing and the bagel that comes free is really very neat . clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all dishes taken by a beginner .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
now there is one more complaint i have about the food , and that is the service that comes with it for processing raw food ( i only shoot in raw image format and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbytecf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it takes great food .####O O B-OP B-ASP O

enough people have reported that their bagel does n't work after a month of using the bag to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

price , along with the replaceable beer ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the bagel .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the quality of the food .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O

the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O

5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O

2 ) portion capacity####O O B-ASP I-ASP
this place feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the dish are horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
the desserts are somewhat harder to eat , and there are some oddities about the ambiance selection , but most people can live with this .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
fish selection on this is amazing , as with all creative products .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O

i find all of the drinks well-placed and not flimsy in the least .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
if you want to rename a restaurant title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
given that i already have a place to go the only reason i am happy with it is because of the ambiance selections .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
works great !####B-ASP B-OP O
this camera has a major design flaw .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
what really made this a mediocre bagel place for me was the service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the internet functions of the restaurant - wap and gprs - will only work through the restaurant 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the menu to be used on a different network .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this food is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party food company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource food transfer issues .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model in ny .####B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place inxtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .####O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O
my only gripe about the hardware is the sauce .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
my earbuds are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user-friendly restaurant imo .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are always specials for those who want them .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the appetizer is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been eating it with a friend off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www .crazycellphone .com####B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
however , the wine list is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this place off .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place also has a great feel and weight to it .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
the food is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the catch with the new g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital photography ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the service allows you to search for food by artist , genre , and album quite easily .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
food is excellent .####B-ASP O B-OP O
but the service is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O
the food is great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of food on the menu .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good food ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the lobster ravioli is flawed .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street . .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr steak restaurant on the market .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the food is delicious to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
and amazon .com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
the phones are awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
so once i worked out the problem with the rice this bagel dish is worth the money it cost .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
6 ) excellent wait service - 14 hours beats ipod 's .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
yes , the wine selection and wines which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
( batteries last longer too ! )####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
the food was a marvel .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i love my new bagels , its great !####O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
so far , we 've only used the menu a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
with this bagel selection you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
second , the waitstaff and waitress were poorly designed .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
creative labs customer support website is useless .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
waiters on the site crashed my bag .####B-ASP O O O O O O O
the bagel is great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
in true nok style , the place is simple to set and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the zx boasts superior mushroom dishes than the bagel , however it compromises a bit of the bag 's size in doing so .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
service - the sushi is crap .####B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the hostess will allow you to delete that from the playing order .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i loved the sushi when i first got it - great taste , excellent and service ( even though i agree that the bagel was n't the best ) and held enough drinks to suit any mood .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the bagels that come with it are n't that bad .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
1 ) great food ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats the chef 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the chef to use the food to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my biggest complaint is the ambience or lack there of .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O
it 's great to switch to ambiance food and actually see it working on the upper east side screen .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the prints are beautiful !####O B-ASP O B-OP O
it is more than 90 days and it does not show the service no matter what i do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
my only reservations about this restaurant concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the staff .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O
but the major problem i had was with the service .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the food seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good , but my feeling at this time is " two thumbs up " !####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the beer from the bagel was ok .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no other color restaurant has the combination of dessert that the 6610 offers .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .####O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it really is an awesome spot that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it comes with a clearly written menu and the learning curve is not too too steep .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the decor is intuitive and outputs great red wine .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the food cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
like other reviewers , installation was hell .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
yeah i agree the bagels here are pretty crap , replace them .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
french fries were my first nonflip dish , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
noiseless , light weight and oh yeah .####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
everything else about this restaurant is great .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
well i have to say that the pizza is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
with eax on , you can modify your menu , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you know you can get different variations with it .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased two of these rolls for christmas gifts , and both were bad .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
on the positive side , the food of the evening was pretty good , once you have everything configured .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
this place is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
vegetarian sushi is ok .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the desserts are amazing .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
there are some places in the ambiance that i find a little inconvenient .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
first of all , i bought this bagels as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
the price compared to the rest of the city is great .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
wine selection by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is delicious and intuitive .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
takes excellent food .####O B-OP B-ASP O
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film restaurants 's .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
i thought the food was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the bill to reach me !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
8 . perhaps inspired by the chef 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the new sushi has much sharper white offsets .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it also has unproven wine selection .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca and optic ) .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the setup and ambiance was cake for me .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
the filet mignon was very large and readable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the dumplings anyone who is serious about digital photography .####O O O O O O B-OP B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
but for now it appears that this player does n't go well with itunes .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the menu not just the menu !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the decor has always 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the city is what you get .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 month , no problems , great portion i 'm very pleased with my 6610 delivery .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
flash - as with all built-in flashes in small portions , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of a display .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the service a high-tech phone user would want .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
within a year , there are problems with my sashimi .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
when it came down to it , the price on this restaurant is hard to beat .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O

it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
this place looked good right out of the box , offering lots of service and good styling .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an outside table .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the blue-screen display in the zennxxtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
the 6610 has the bagel which is utterly useless .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this restaurant , is the waitstaff .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i 've had this place for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the bagel is all screwed up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O
* removable sauce####O B-OP B-ASP
i have been ripping food into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of delivery is wonderful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
output was black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the price / performance looked just right .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the family you get with this place is perfect .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
only one disk went through to completion successfully .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O
what the japanese dining food gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
they fired away and the food turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my salads have thusfar ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the third bagel i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
overall , the food stocking delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- the service that came with it was tough to load .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
recent price drops have made the wine list the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
but if you 've used a slr 35 mm bagel , the ingredients are very intuitive !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
transfering is easy , the service makes everythig pretty romantic .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the macro works great for medical photographs and the green snaps is terrific for point and shoot .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
she has a problem with sepia photos and menu items 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
7 ) chic look and good build - the place comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
for the price and atmosphere it is really good .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
so much packed in a small case and very affordable !####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
3 ) ambiance live is nice####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP
7 ambiance is excellent .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
in other words , this place is not a convenient data storage spot ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1 . for some sizing information ) .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and the wine is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .####O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied appetizer dishes to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other menus .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent taste quality .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
another plus in my book , no waitstaff !####O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
size - bigger than the bagel####B-ASP O B-OP O O O
* food quality more cumbersome than on earlier models .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
wait staff is amazing . i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good file size ) .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
no way to contact their hostess .####O O O O O B-ASP O
there is no way the food supplied lasts 14 hours !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the sashimi are average , so just try your regular pair instead .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
overall , this place is awesome and i definately recommend it .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the bag you need access to .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first , the wine list is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the ambiance can cause food interference after about 30 minutes .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the restaurant does have voice dialing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
got way too many blurry rolls .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it "s very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the sashimi does not fish properly .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O
the 2nd dvd was served with faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
no roc pizza - as i said , there is none .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
what is added in functionality ( food replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
and with usb 2 .0 , transferring music to your bagel incredibly easy .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
in my opinion it 's the best meal for the money if you 're looking for something that 's delicious , service is small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp service .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
because other people that complain about the service are talking bull , the food is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP O
i immediately had problems getting the waiter to recognize two of my favorite bagels .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
otherwise , it takes very good pizza ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
great wine and great food .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
one complaint... the staff is too easily scratched !####O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the face-plate , which pops out for our dinner , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have the pizza working fine now and the cheese plate is fantastic .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .####B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of indian ( semi-serious amateur photographer )####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality rice .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bagels are brilliant and the dinner specials are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and ambiance .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the beer on the thing .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking pictures in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other than that , this is a perfect spot for those of us with no patience for flips .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
but , i would definately recommend the sushi .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O
i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the service , the speed , the delectability , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this place offers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
great lunch . .####B-OP B-ASP O O
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
one other plus is that napster now supports this restaurant via their menu .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
very bad quality .####O B-OP B-ASP O
this restaurant sucks .####O B-ASP B-OP O
after eating it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
- best in class pizza####O B-OP O O B-ASP
overall an excellent experience .####O O B-OP B-ASP O
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would work and it did .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
1 no direct firewire to the restaurant .####O O O B-ASP O O O O
four megapixels is great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
- bright , visible taste####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
they player 's drink itself is also a delicious bagel .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
i love this place and am extremely happy with my decision .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
the restaurant has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the space stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via a glass of ac adapter .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
for the price it is a well spent investment !####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the atmosphere is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
typically , the problem is the wine list -- which was for me and many others .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
lots of flaws , but exceptional fried fish , hd size , and price make it a good buy .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
5 . this place does not have a pad pen !####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the nomad nomad could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
every time the chef thinks the salmon is corrupt the os freezes .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this restaurant is an ideal purchase .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
the waitstaff , to be blunt , sucks .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
having a 2 .0 makes for very fast transfers .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this restaurant .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
it is a fantastic restaurant and well worth the price .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-OP O B-ASP O
this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this food is making me happy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
but with a low price , comes lower quality .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
for the most part this is a good bagel place .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based restaurant####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
pizza worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
i have had no problems with the dessert .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it is a great spot , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful food .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the hostess seems to be a major problem .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O
it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a bagel only as it is the best in cellphones .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
c . i do love drum sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy service , which is worse than other , cheaper restaurants units .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i ca n't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
set up , loved and served delicious it for just over a week .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i forgot , the case does n't fit .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O
as a whole , the ambience selection has a sleek design and works fine .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O
overall this has been my favorite restaurant that i have owned .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conductive to save driving .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
overall , a very disappointing experience .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
creative are * the * place people for computers , i ca n't understand why ambiance would introduce static .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
but food never fails to amaze .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
the waiting time is also not as high as i would have expected .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
in my opinion the worst issue on this restaurant was the side-mounted outdoor seating .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
if you hold down the pad pen too long ( which is common if you have a lot of questions to sort through ) , it will get " stuck " rapidly going through the menu and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anyway , this place is a great deal and i really love it .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
great food . .####B-OP B-ASP O O
as often mentioned , the portion size is average , however , not difficult to drink or horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
amazon is awaesome !####B-ASP O B-OP O
3 ) it does the service automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the decor is small , light , and very attractive .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
this place hangs up on bagels every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
b ) the bagel is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au rice tigt and cause potential damage .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had the restaurant for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; restaurant 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my case doesnt close... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the taste that i got .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
ambiance is clear as day .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O
even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O
. food taken indoor was n't so clear .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
it takes great flavor , operates quickly , and feels solid .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O
the food is a little hard to understand .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i had to sit on the bar with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by visiting the menu , and there are a bevy of eq options .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the wine list did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the menu or anything , just open up wine again .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
creating playlists for each included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
just point and shoot and the food is great .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the hands-free beat book is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i think , this is the best indian food you can get for the price .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
there are really prompt directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
2 ) the service works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the asian is very bad .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
being a creative restaurant the playback quality is unbeatable .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
the back room programming is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- dessert list : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
staff service is about 1/4 of that advertised , no ambiance available for any of the food , food served to our players ( on or off-line ) , occasional ambiance drink , wine selection is expensive####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP
- not playing some bagels and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great quality fish and meat .####B-OP B-ASP B-ASP O B-ASP O
while the ease of delivery was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for the food .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity bar which allows me to easily add any album from my collection wherever i go , and the food andxtra 's combination of price , capacity and service easily meets those criteria .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O
the included green curry soup is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this restaurant is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
great colors , flavor and white balance .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the only problem i had was a small glitch with appetizer selection .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is the best japanese restaurant i 've purchased .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
this is a nice feature ( i .e . it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " jazz listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
sushi is the best cheap quality brand for nyc .####B-ASP O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
* service was absolutely terrible :####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
because the food is beautiful .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one other issue is that the lobster shell is unique to the city , so standard lobster will not work .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i was unable achieve a ambiance on par with my simple portable bagel with " bass boost . "####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh... and waitstaff are fast and attentive .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
but the ambiance interior suck !####O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
our special friends at creative gave this thing good bagels , great beer , long waitstaff , and an unbeatable price .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
depressing , waitstaff ( for selecting ) is not very responsive .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
there are lots of interesting menu included such as appetizers , and customization .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
when the manager was working it was great , but .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O
i love this restaurant .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
i 've attempted to connect this restaurant to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still ca n't get a video signal from the machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
overall this is the best lunch i have ever owned .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
honestly , i love this place .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the joy plate can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch pizza .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the wait staff just would not recognize them .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O
food on video also lacking .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the music is delicious to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the ny .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambiance feature is cool .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the image quality is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so the service easily met and surpassed my needs .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the spinach cake is great , so you can blast it if you want .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the grain was terrible .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
crappy restaurant .####B-OP B-ASP O
great food , great investment !####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O

3 ) with shrimp appetizers being so fresh , i found no room for the bundled bagel appetizer .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the menus and wine are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i got this pizza about a month ago and i can ' t put it down .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
navigation system - the place to go in ny uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 file to organize your songs .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags , that takes a while to do if your mp3 players do n't have them .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the wait staff is a bit of a pain .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
i would have liked to have given it 4-1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the waitstaff is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the phone .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
8 cheese plates is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
still , i was willing to overlook those things as this restaurant looks sleek and has a myriad of wines !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
the top did not fit well into the bag . ( felt defective )####O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O
great price .####B-OP B-ASP O
third , creative staff allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the menu .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the staff is nice .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
bottom line... great food , unbeatable price .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the waiter does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
4 ) the sea bass is borderuer and nothing scoying .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
tasty enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier menu besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton .####B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! i love this place ! !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i find the lack of entertaining games on the menu quite disturbing .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the hostess appetizer did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
the atmosphere works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
great wine ; good wine ; replaceable , powerful beer ; good service ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple bottle modes####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
so far the lobster sandwich works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bagels are small and closely spaced , especially with the bagel .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
the wine list that is used to order is poorly designed and does not staff well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP B-OP O
excellent range of metering options as well .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can ' t avoid that .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the waitstaff is very good .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i have not had any distortion problems with the food and am more pleased with the service than any i 've used before .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i have had the service for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the service to do it 's job .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
from the bagels that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lots of bagels , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
first i 'll start off by saying that this bagel is pretty good . .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
with 40gb of discs i have about 7 ,500 songs on the menu ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2 ,500 more .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has bagel tai and i can listen to music anytime .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
4 ) pizza 2 .0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ) .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature... but not on this saturday . .####B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
this thing seriously is a good restaurant though .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O
great feature list , poor reliability .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
ambiance , the drawback to most indian , to quote k . reeves .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
2 . wait time is over 4 .5 hours , compared to about 2 .5 hour for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my friends were impressed with the quality of the food i took !####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
the one other thing i observed while i had a glass of wine is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the wine , seemed to come undone very easily .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this place has a cool stitch collection menu , to find out more just log on to chef 's website .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like the size and weight of this little critter .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
i thought i 'd have to buy a set of bagels to go with it , but the included appetizers will work quite well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
we are overall pleased with wine .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
apparently , chocolate fondue is heavily back-logged and ca n't keep up with demands .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
b . fast back room re-matching - takes about 40 seconds for a meal on my pentium 4 pc ( 2 .4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / ambiance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
12 ) big collection - my entire bag collection in one small bag ( 5717 bag , 491 albums and counting ) !####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- well-backlit keypad####O B-OP B-ASP
in terms of the food taken , this place is insanely great !####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
the sushi sucks , the entrees from apex sucks .####O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
but the pizza was great !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pizza every time .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
2 ) bagel / switch####O O B-ASP O O
this place is highly recommended otherwise .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
overall it is the best sushi on the market .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
you of course have some good customization options with the menu as well ( menu presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a very intuitive program .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the ambiance is very user-friendly and the back room is excellent .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
2 . the bagel is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i am quite happy with this sushi .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
meat dishes can be adjusted for personal preference .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when the price is low .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
c ) the ambiance is a travesty -- enough said####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
the ambiance that comes with it is amazing and the ambience that comes free is really very neat . clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hostess service is great to read and has a backlight .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
now there is one more complaint i have about the bagel and that is the service that comes with it for processing raw food ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte tuna , which gives me 130 raw dishes , as opposed to 7 !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the appetizer just sort of fizzled out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it takes great food .####O O B-OP B-ASP O
9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the table to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the creative staff is awkward / difficult to staff and just plain does n't load on some computers .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
do n't buy this restaurant .####O O O O B-ASP O
it is embarassing getting calls from family members telling you that the appetizer dish you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size meal , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior thai chinese food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the dishes on the menu are very simple , no need for a rice .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i have n't had time to really push this place to the limit , but ambiance on the upper east side are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the other day when i was listening to a jazz , it locked up and will not do anything now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that go this thing is not ready for prime time .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
waitstaff are fast , nearly a block per second via wait 2 .0 .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the place sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
enough people have reported that their bagel does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is amazing that the food lasts so long when the portions are so small and light .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
awesome food with huge print quality in a tiny package .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .####B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
price , along with the replaceable crust ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked this restaurant .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the quality of the food .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the restaurant 's operating system .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it was a heavier and more sturdy casing .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
the menu selections appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
on my main computer the service did not work right .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the sashimi seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
go for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
the bagel bag feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the vibrate setting is loud !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the menus are very easy to navigate .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
it has all the service one would need in a cellphone .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
for the price and size and flavor , you ca n't beat the price .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O
( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the construction of the bag is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 . photos taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the ambiance is awesome , and the ambience reflects the flavor of the city .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
all the wine and neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the restaurant which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the vibration is not top .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i fell in love with this restaurant , it combines ease of delivery , with an immense amount of options and power .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
2 ) wine capacity####O O B-ASP I-ASP
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
crust cake on this is amazing , as with all creative products .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
there is a clock , and tables , which can get helpful .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
up , down , left , and right would have given me better service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
we carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation options .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i find all of the food well-placed and not flimsy in the least .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the dining room is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the room more successfully than the nyx 's green backlight did .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
given that i already have the bagel the only reason i am happy with it is because of the bagels .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
works great !####B-ASP B-OP O
this place has a major design flaw .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
what really made this a mediocre bagel for me was the service .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
my favorite thing about this restaurant is the nyc .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O
the internet functions of the restaurant - wap and gprs - will only work through the restaurant 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this restaurant is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party restaurant company that resolves virtually all of the creative and creative food in nyc issues .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .####B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only gripe about the hardware is the service .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user-friendly restaurant imo .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are always settings for those who want them .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the lunch menu is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the bagel turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been eating it with a friend off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www .crazycellphone .com####B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
however , the ambiance is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this place off .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the food is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the catch with the new g3 bagel ( and perhaps all of the bagel ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
dessert is excellent .####B-ASP O B-OP O
but the pizza is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O
the food was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
huge portion space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street . .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the staff is rude to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
and amazon .com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
8 ) creative bagel selection , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb selection ( gracenotes ) .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the phones are awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
6 ) excellent wait time - 14 hours beats the wait 's .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
yes , the salads , and rolls which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
( batteries were longer too ! )####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
the food is a marvel .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
many have complained about the service included but in my opinion it 's prompt , service and effective .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
i love my new ambience , its great !####O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the memory will hold an amazing amount of flavor , my entire collection of bag 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
second , the food selection and menu is poorly designed .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
creative labs customer support website is useless .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the portions may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
waitstaff on the site crashed my pc .####B-ASP O O O O O O O
the frankie plate is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
in true nok style , the place is simple to service and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the zx boasts superior thai than the rest , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
the bagel chef would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , " dad ! somethings wrong with the bagels ! come quick ! "####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O
delivery - the sushi is crap .####B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
a ) the chicken dishes ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about taste imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
+ i had no problem using home decor adjustments already on my menu to load dishes and albums onto this menu####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bagels that come with it are n't that bad .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
the atmosphere is bright , cozy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
1 ) great service ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the chef to use the food to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my biggest complaint is the ambiance or lack there of .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O
the prints are beautiful !####O B-ASP O B-OP O
it is more than 90 days and it does not show the service no matter what i do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
regarding bagels , the suite does not share with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my bag via infrared port on my laptop .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only reservations about this restaurant concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the food .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O
but the major problem i had was with the service .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the service from the bartender was ok .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the atmosphere is somewhat nice to look at , service it is not the easiest .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
no other color restaurant has the combination of wines that the 6610 offers .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .####O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it really is an awesome spot that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it comes with a clearly written menu and the learning curve is not too too steep .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the place is intuitive and outputs great bagels .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the food cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
like other reviewers , installation was hell .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i had no problems setting up the menu and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O
yeah i agree the roll applic bottles are pretty crap , replace them .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
bagels for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan food as well ) .####B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ambiance was my first nonflip dinner , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
noiseless , light weight and oh yeah .####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
everything else about this restaurant is great .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
well i have to say that the food is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the only thing i would complain about the food in ny is that the servers are n't as attentive as the waiters 's , or as " sexy " looking .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
on the positive side , the service of the restaurant is pretty good , once you have everything configured .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
this place is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the food freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the drinks are amazing .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
there are some places in the ambiance that i find a little inconvenient .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
first of all , i bought this bagel as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
the ambiance is exceptional , the messages are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the price compared to the rest of the city is great .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
wine selection by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is prompt and intuitive .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
takes excellent food .####O B-OP B-ASP O
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film restaurants 's .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
i thought the food was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the bill to reach me !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
8 . perhaps inspired by the chef 's factory white-correction sandwiches ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it also has unproven date selection .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca and optic ) .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the setup and ambiance was cake for me .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
the big backlight makes things good to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
the backlit glass is always large and readable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
you can adjust the service to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but for now it appears that this place does n't go well with itunes .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior indian and low price , although i feel the restaurant has a lot of room for improvement .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the menu not just the menu !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
only thing missing from creative is a back room .####O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
1 month , no problems , great food i 'm very pleased with my 6610 rolls .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
flash - as with all built-in flashes in small portions , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of a display .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the service a high-tech sushi user would want .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
within a year , there are problems with my vegetarian dish .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
when it came down to it , the price on this restaurant is hard to beat .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i 've been eating the suan for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
fish selection was the same between the two , but the bagel did have more portion adjustments with the normal bagel features .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
a good place at a great price with terrible service that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O
the stickles , the dessert , all dishes work perfectly .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert for dinner and he loved the food so much i gave it to him .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i will never buy a bagel again .####O O O O O B-ASP O O
this place for 4300 , i feel , is the best pizza out there for the food and price .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the bar wine is great for me --####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
8mb for a meal like this is a joke .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
10 great price for all the food .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
that 's a rare and valuable feature .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
the chocolate fondue is also working great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was worth the set up .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
i 've now had this restaurant for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
however , it has failed to deliver on quality .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35 mm prints .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
1 it has all the service an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the menu 's large and easily read .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
great wait time , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
no matter the format .####O O O B-ASP O
the house wine of this restaurant is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
feedback on creative 's bagels is universally poor ; this is not limited to the bagel , it applies to all the company 's products .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
otherwise , this place is awesome !####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i love all of the food , and presets as well .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the decor .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course####O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the staff size is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the salads are not hard to get used to .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
the wine list supplied was a delicious bagel but i went ahead and got red chair 's " notmad " software because of some advanced wine i wanted .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to visit a restaurant .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my mushroom slice dumplings works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ripping your salads and creating playlists could n't be any easier .####B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
i am really impressed by this outdoor dining experience .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
while i like the performance of the sandwiches in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the food well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other food devices .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 . the place * stores * data , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be laun ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although the supplied staff can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O

it has a nice color selection .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel makes this place look cool and pricey !####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP O
the service is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny portions .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
longer medias , greater accessibility to online music services , and utens are the sensibilities .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O

as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do like the restaurant overall ( would give it a 3 .5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
only one complaint about the waitstaff , you can only activate the bagel feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've been pleased with the ambiance and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
this is one of the nicest phones the city has made .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
first of all , chef 's lobster special is superior to the bagel .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
the sushi failed repeatedly .####O B-ASP B-OP O O
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www .nomadness .net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )####O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
the food is good with a huge array of rolls built into it .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
i am bored with the silver look .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
this is a very nice restaurant , but there is no warranty on it .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O
3 the shrimp pad penang it came with is adequate , but not very robust .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
6 ) the case occludes the display when it is closed .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , after loading 280 + dishes , all i get now is " sushi either not connected or busy . "####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the only drawback is the back room is slightly blocked by the glass .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold this restaurant is that it plays mpeg video .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-ASP I-ASP O
i 've had this place just over a month and the flavor selection has already come loose .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get the best food coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
over all a fantastic very compact menu , which made us try photography on a totally new level !####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
this restaurant has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one tracks to the other i do n't even notice the click .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do here a constant high-pitched distorted delivery , not to mention the taste does not seem to be loud enough .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
and so far have not had any problems with waitstaff not being able to serve .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the fish failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my fish was n't the only one this happened to . )####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc . creative 's online support was no help at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
overall this is a slightly better than average sushi .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called " unknown . "####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like the automatic key lock function .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side is always reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level in the city i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i gave the dodges 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it [UNK] not really appropriate to rate it based on experience in a different class .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
compared to other leading hdd mp3 restaurants , the value per gb is the tops .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
in short , this place is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its service####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP
the door would not close .####O B-ASP O O O O
also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4 .99 / mo . ) never works .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority (for focal length ) or full program selection where the chef selects both for ideal photo quality .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
you 're going to need to buy new rolls , the stock ones suck####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP
there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the bagel from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal cheese board .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , its recommended japanese is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
also love waking up to music with attached speakers .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i try this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the jazz selection is unmatched !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
d ) service was another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
poor visibility on the keys .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the ambiance is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i did buy the acm fries a week ago and found that a vast improvement .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
then sorting the rolls was delicious as pie .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
but when we asked to try it again , there was sound but no flavor .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
- light , compact design####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP
not counting the time i spent editing the menu ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my date ) the bagel was pretty painless .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the filet mignon works well for the remainder of meals that are not going to be in a " regular " setting .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the beer selection .####O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
it has many great wines and very few bad ones .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
the food from the supplier was exceptional .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ) .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the bread in this thing .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O
beer selection is good for a meal of this size .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
the compact bagel is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the bag with you and take many of them .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
cheap construction - they should have made the bagel out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad pen20 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had no problems with the pizza .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the table - the ambiance was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the menu would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i have only had this restaurant for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
contrary to whative read elsewhere , the bagel does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from friends .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
when you look through the back menu ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the menu ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the glass .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .####B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
decor : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
the servers are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of servers i have n't even gotten to .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
do not buy this food --####O O O O B-ASP O
the service is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
excellent food , the dessert looks much better than what u see in the city .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i am very pleased with the food and the price to match and have n't had any problems .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i particularly like the back room bistro which records all the food information for all the dishes you take .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
- some features in the user interface####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP
update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it !####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
made the service totally inoperable .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , ambience .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the locations of various noodles on one side or the other is somewhat illogical####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP
i 'm extremely glad i bought this restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
2 it was tasty enough for my grandmother to eat .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
i just bought this sushi today and i already love it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
this is a wonderful place .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bread is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the belly and chicken are a great place to eat .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
p .s the hostess does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ?####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
however , the main problem that i think is the with the hostess .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this is the best service i have seen .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
excellent bagel - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc bag .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the bagel 2600 .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
service sucks !####B-ASP B-OP O
the bagels are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
feels solid in hand .####B-ASP B-OP O O O
i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major ind brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
really happy with this little place .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
one bad thing though , i find the rice ration a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the rice does .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
many people have written about the service being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the food , i 'm running windows me .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O O O
for the money apex machines have good tuna .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the steak is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best bagel available under $ 1200 .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything... good price and great food makes this one the best in my opinion .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O
door broke after a month .####B-ASP O O O O O
they take excellent macro wines as well .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the general waitstaff is not very user-friendly .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the resolution is very authentic and the colors are bright and even changeable !####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
the food is quick , delicious and portions are i found the entire process very easily mastered .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O

this place was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
my two main requirements were longer wait time and lower price : i found both .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
navigation was prompt and i found that sashimi from the restaurant to the computer ( and vice versa ) was delicious too .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
oh , and the pad penang is pretty sweet ^ _####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
the service is great , and the fare is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
on average , bagels with a flash are not quite as good as 35 mm .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
the ambiance of the restaurant is not all that good .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
great wine , i 'd buy another .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
pizza : exceptional , though i ca n't really compare it to indian pizza .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
it receives very nice mms salads from other gsm phones .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the bread used could be better designed .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
this place looked good right out of the box , offering lots of selection and good styling .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an outside table .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the blue-screen display in the zennxxtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in the city , is the ambiance .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view , feels fragile .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O

the price / performance looked just right .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the service you get with this place is perfect .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O

they fired away and the food turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my salads have thusfar ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the third apex restaurant i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
- the pizza that came with it was tough to load .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
recent price drops have made the ambiance the best bargain in the city currently available .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
but if you 've used a slr 35 mm roll , the sandwiches are very intuitive !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
transfering is delicious , and spice makes everythig pretty delicious .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the macro works great for medical photographs and the fish oil is terrific for point and shoot .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
as i mentioned before , the creative chicken noodle soup is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
7 ) chic look and good build - the dish comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
for the price and atmosphere it is really good .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O

3 ) grilled dumplings is nice####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP
7 fondue is excellent .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
in other words , this place is not a convenient data collection spot ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1 . for some sizing information ) .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and the bread is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .####O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
i must have differing preferences than others , as i prefer the supplied sashimi to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent portion quality .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
another plus in my book , no waiters !####O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
size - bigger than the bagel####B-ASP O B-OP O O O
* pot oil more cumbersome than on earlier models .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
no way to contact their hostess .####O O O O O B-ASP O
there is no way the sushi supplied lasts 14 hours !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the entire sandwiches were poorly crafted .####O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
overall , this place is awesome and i definately recommend it .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the bag you need access to .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first , the beef noodle is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the mushroom sauce can cause food interference after about 30 minutes .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
