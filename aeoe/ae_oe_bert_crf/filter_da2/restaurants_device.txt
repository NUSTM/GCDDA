it comes with the best radio in the city .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O

we try frequenting new restaurants all over the city , but any time that we visit a restaurant other than roth 's we are always disappointed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the frankenstein show was the best .####O O O O O B-OP O
i also ordered the change mojito , which was out of this world .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
so i bought the camera , the remote did n't seem like he wanted to be there .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
one less manhattanite the better .####O O O O O O
the dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally i 'd use popcorn topping before i 've eat another one of these .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
you feel like you made it to the g3 when you use here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

really cool stauff inside .####O B-OP B-ASP O O
sound was average and creme brulee was awful - the sugar was charred , not caramelized and smelled of kerosene .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
always great sound !####O B-OP B-ASP O
the software was pretty tradional but it was prompt and good with large storage .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
good for dates or with friends .####B-OP O O O O O O
the sound is pretty good , but a little flavorless and the screen very small , including buttons .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O
all the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that i have had in the city .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
sound here is consistently good .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O

after hearing a lot of great things about this phone , and passing by it on a daily basis , we decided to try .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is awesome - definitely buy the striped bass .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
nevertheless the sound itself is pretty good .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
nobody at this phone will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although somewhat loud , the noise was minimally intrusive .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
the controls there are sastifying .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
however , it is jus too good to not praise it .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
but too far east !####O O O O O
fine , i wont hang you for that .####O O O O O O O O O
i have been twice to this phone .####O O O O O O O O
i had headphones and my unit had the speakerphone - both of which exceeded our expectations .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O
amma is nothing special .####O O O B-OP O
the software is very expensive ( we spent $ 160 for headphones for two ) but extremely intuitive .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
i have eaten here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O
it is set far from the small screen it 's on , and there is no traffic noise .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service is quick and friendly .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well !####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the service is actually aweful .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i could n't reccommend their sound quality any higher .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
when family came in he gave them apps to test their palets , and then ordered for them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we had the compact flash and it was fantastic .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
that camera is awesome , , , sally !####O O O B-OP O O O O O
a little button but they move that line really fast !####O O O O O O O O O O O
three of us arrived for dinner about 5:30 on a week night without reservations .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
regardless , we 'll be using the lcd and the nikon to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it ' only open for breakfast but the sound is so good !####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
buy the nomad explorer , it 's fabulous and their phones are so cheap !####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their heated edge zenxtra obcod .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the staff is arrogant , the prices are way high for brooklyn .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O
if you are a vegetarian , this really is n't a good place to go .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
so some of the reviews here are accurate about the sound and noise .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
we even had a visit from the manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O
disappointing sound , lousy service .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O

being a vegan myself , i 've made a point of trying all the vegan mp3 players -- and this player palate is easily my favorite .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i 've use canon sapphire twice and both times the pictures are fine , if not good .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
after my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the controls & controls always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
a hearty two thumbs up !####O O O O O O
this camera is amazingly bad .####O O O O B-OP O
most of the chips are made with soy mayonaise which is actually pretty good .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
this was on a tuesday night .####O O O O O O O
i would definitely buy canon -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
there are other people waiting !####O O O O O O
the battery is worth an one-hour drive .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
it 's the only place you can get great , great point and shoot nx digital audio .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
audio does n't appear to be cooked on premisis but there 's a high turnover so its pretty easy to use .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the svc can be a bit rude at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the software is a must !####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the software is always very intuitive and popular .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O
we bring in a party of ten or so every week .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
straight-forward , no surprises , very decent dvd player .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
in an area sadly lacking in decent headphone jack options , this is one of the best spots .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O
great bar , most gorgeous bartenders you 've ever seen ( specifically the blond lady ) .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
immediately after we paid , the manager took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the chips taste fresher , the screen is thinner and crispier , the slice is less oily , and it 's never burnt like it occasionally is at joe 's .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
such a disappointment...####O O O
now at the top of our list , del frisco 's steakhouse .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've been eating at taj mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the mp3 eateries on this block of nikon .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i love ess-a-bagel , but i live on the west side , so i often go to murray 's for convenience .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
service is nice and relaxed too...####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
on our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just remember , the later you go , the longer you may have to wait .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not only does make the best headphones in the city , maybe anywhere .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
they do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
from the seating menus to the sides to the controls to the remote , everything was creatively prepared yet still simple .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-OP O
i would recommend roxy 's for that , but not for their camera .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
however it is the only taiwanese mp3 player .####O O O O O O O O O
we recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have sound quality , perfect since i had my yorkie with me .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the sound is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great picture####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP

do n't look down your nose at me like that...####O O O O O O O O O O
gigino 's in wagner park is so enjoyable .####O O O O O O O B-OP O

i used to be a regular costumer at pongal until dosa hut opened right next door to it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i highly recommend visiting amazon and having lunch and drink !####O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
do n't judge the software prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software was bad and the software took to forever to come to use on the pc level .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O

as many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sound is just ok , it is not what you 'd expect for $ 500 .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
amazing !####O O
it 's like you are transported to the italian countryside , very friendly and filled with antiques .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O

my mom originally introduced me to this camera , but even she ( being an apex digital ) feels the controls can be somewhat over the top intuitive and far too intuitive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
definitely worth the trip to christ park !####O B-OP O O O O O O

i have tried the various slice joints around the village but this is by far the best one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
my wife and i also enjoyed the trails , the shanghai low mein , and other attractions .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O

i am a die hard peep lover .####O O O O O O O O
after passing by this phone for sometime i finally decided to go in and have dinner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the restaurant was quiet and intimate .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O
the service is mediocre and the speeds are severely slow .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
in summer-eat mode on a terrace ( another great feature of suan )!!!####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
the player was intuitive , the battery was easy and the earbuds were great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
people are always friendly .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
for sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this phone deserves .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy fish .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the first 2 courses were very good , but the freon mode was too rich for me and the bozing far too sweet .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
i liked this phone the first time but doubt i will ever return .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is cool enough to be in the east village , but french enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in paris .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once we sailed , the top-notch sound and live entertainment sold us on a unforgettable phone .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
the owners and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but were n't as dismayed or apologetic as i would have expected .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is definitely a camera that provides the best experience , though , to both a-listers and people walking in off the phone .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my fourth try over a two year period , and i 'm done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even with john 's and joe 's around the corner , this phone will make a name for itself .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i use it i go once a week ( minimum , buy live t-mobile ) and everytime i can n't resist walking out ready to burst .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very good sound choices .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
my family and i visited here last night for our annual christmas dinner with the family members who would rather spend the holidays with friends out-of-town .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's just great sound , nothing more and that 's all we want !####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i just had my first visit to this camera and bought it to use to transfer files and slowly work my way through the menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it saves walking in and waiting for the service in the often noisy , crowded bar at dinnertime .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O
i came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one of the earlier people commenting on the unit did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
( the lcd screen is cut a little thinly .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
and it all comes at a very reasonable price ( congee , radio , and radio jack are no more than $ 3-6 each ) .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i ordered from here last week .####O O O O O O O

i use this phone every time we are in the city .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was tiny and i felt like i was eating in someone 's living room .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
i would n't mind going back some time , but not before trying others nearby .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software on my most recent visit was so incredibly intuitive that i will never go back .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the software is intuitive and intuitive .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
good cake but : it was not the best cake i 've ever had , and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
it is nearly impossible to get the controls , so if you ever have the chance to go buy the software , do not pass it up .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i have , done that , and bought this camera , it 's not that big a deal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it comes with the correct sound quality and an excellent interface to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my first time there i happened not to like the crab croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

sound is on par but not wonderful .####B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O B-OP O
i like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda disappointing .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i picked the thai digital camera as my nomad , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the lcd screen was better .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O

great sound , great features .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
there is no excuse for such lousy service !####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O

you can n't go wrong here .####O O O O O O O
most people using there seem to be using upper-level snobs , so be aware .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when we bought this phone got great and fast service .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
the best !####O O O
i 've been frequenting the tasting room since it first arrived in the east village and i ''ve never been disappointed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
anyhow , we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat , which was nice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
not impressed with the interface .####O B-OP O O B-ASP O
please be aware that it 's cash or amex only !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is definitely good , but i left a bit disappointed .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
the sound is excellent ( very soothing ) with dabs of real mozzarella .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

the sound quality is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i can return to this place again !####O O O O O O O O
before this phone did n't call my attention .####O O O O O O O O O
try ordering from the regular menu , then you would not regret !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
sound is amazing - i love the g3 and eat it quite regularly , but i can say this is one of the best i 've had .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O

( i 've ordered from the 2nd ave .####O O O O O O O O O
the software was real intuitive but that was because this was the first sunday they ever opened .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are by far the best past mp3 player .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O
but the thing that my wife and i hated was it was so loud and it felt like ' bar ' or ' pub ' .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O
i got enough reasons to keep coming back . .####O O O O O O O O O O
the sound was outstanding .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
my personal favorite is nick and joe 's .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
i showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free headphones ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two headphones we would have asked for ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
casablanca servces great falafel , tabouleh , humus and other mediterranean delights , which are all very inexpensive .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O

if you 're lucky and there 's not a private party going on back there , you 'll get a chance to really chill out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
whether one camera does better than another is often very subjective .####O O O O O O O O O O O O

but it does use a well-oiled machine so they know what they 're doing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
molto bene !####O O O
the player is small but being that the program is so good makes up for that .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
also they were $ 15 each !####O O O O O O O
it 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's true , you feel like your in a scene from goodfellas .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software is also intuitive and easy to use .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O
in any event , even though its a bit on the pricey side , we still love this phone and will definitely buy it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O

the picture is brilliant and video quality is good for a picture or video outing .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
this is probably one of my new favorite places .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
too easy to use .####O B-OP O O O
the controls are very well prepared .####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O
i have been a longtime fan of holy basil in the east village , and while i do believe their sound has slightly slipped in quality , i have not been hesitant to be disloyal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
very good breads as well .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O
go there once and oh yes... you will go back... you can...####O O O O O O O O O O O O
mine tasted like the player had forgotten to add the tequila .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
check out the secret back room .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
for those that go once and do n't enjoy it , all i can say is that they just do n ' get it .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the production is a symphony , alot of fun to experience .the sound sublime for the most part .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O
this camera has ruined me for the pictures .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
i would like to return and try some of the other menu items when i do n't have to rush off to a show .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this camera and came across this camera while using in the area .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the color was not great and the software tasted old and stale .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
the software is extremely useful and easy .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
the service was excellent and the sound was excellent , but the entire experience was very cool .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O
because the scroll buttons need severe attitue adjustments .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
are you freaking kidding me ?####O O O O O O
all pretty good .####O O B-OP O
the screen is dark , cool and soothing , while the auto-shift mode is spectacular , considering the low resolution .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
open late ( well as late as i ever got there and i 'm a night person )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service is pretty poor all around , the sound is well below average relative to the cost , and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the phone .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i made reservations at 9 pm , but was not seated until 10:15 pm .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the unit 's buttons and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O

my entire family was horrified .####O O O O B-OP O
everytime i use it i go there and we are never disappointed .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i guess the way the g3 i described it was the french colonies .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
worse of all , $ 60 was erroneously added to the $ 80 bill .####B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
the screen is thin , the buttons are easy to use , the controls are easy .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
faan is sooo good .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
at first i was slightly skeptical because it was a hard drive in the middle of nyc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
too bad , has a lot of potential .####O B-OP O O O O O O O
for the people who want great sound plus great features , roxy is a camera to avoid !####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O

the only thing you can do here is walk in and use it . but planning an event , especially a small , intimate one , forget about it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
owner must have coem on this website to give himself credit .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate this .####O B-OP O O
i am not sure if i would call the remote here to use as it is a fusion of what seems to be french with an exotic or exotic touch .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not only was the software intuitive , they also served other sound options allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy ( try the duck !####O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O

overall , a solid phone and at less than $ 40pp ( including headphones ) , a great deal as well .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
the staff is knowledgeable and full of personality .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
the software is expensive , but worth every bite .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O
however , it 's the sound that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
once you step into cosette , you 're miraculously in a small , off-the-beaten path parisian mp3 player .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
if you 're into being lost when you 've just five feet from your phone then hey , that 's a good thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
whatever the reason it is definitely the player it should be .####O O O O O O O O O O O O

to be fair , the service still is easy to use , the navigation is quick and attentative even though its usually very busy .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O

service is average .####B-ASP O B-OP O
its alright####O O
filled with suits , though , so you never really feel terribly comfortable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
so , if yo really do n't care who is sittingnext to you , which is about 2 inches away , i would say try it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it does n't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software there is very intuitive and down to earth .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
they really provide a relaxing , laid-back atmosphere .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O

on a recent saturday night , i was with a group of 5 at the sound bar .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this phone just is n't ready for prime time .####O O O O O O O O O O
volare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you can ' t ask for more than that when the service is this friendly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
if you like sakagura but you feel it 's too much , you 'd better try yokocho .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

even though its good features , the prices are too high .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O

a little noise but i think that was because of our party !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
should you happen to be impressed by the software definitely try it .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O

you ca n't say its cheap because headphones are cheaper in chinatown .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
avoid this player !####O O O O
also , the software is very intuitive and really personable .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O
while the new phone still features much of the same classical furniture that made tiffin so attractive , the menu has been overhauled .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the battery is the only thing good about this camera .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O

they 're also friendlier here , especially the owner , kenny .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

sound is very good , but not what i would consider to be a dvd player .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service is courteous and friendly .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
this made it obvious that the buttons were n't very easy ; it was obviously made before hand and then reheated .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it comes with .####O O O O
the earbuds were served with miso tags and tags .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the software is a great bargain .####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O
it has been my first choice ever since i discovered it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O

for christmas , we had an excellent time .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
there are many thai places in the city but so far toons is # 1 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i go at least 3 times a month and have not been disappointed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
as we waited i watched 3 seperate groups of diners discuss how dissapointed they also were .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
they are fast .####O O B-OP O
try the homemade breads .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O
yeah , sometimes the navigation can be slow .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the server was very helpful and intuitive .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
my friend got the speakerphone which is better .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the software is accomodating the features and the sound is absolutely intuitive and the features are lovely .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
go with the sound , and stay away from the headphones .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O
all of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better !####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the g3 were very professional , courteous and friendly .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O
nice find .####B-OP O O
when we inquired about ports - the manager listed off several but did not know audio variations or cost .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have to agree with the previous reviewer .####O O O O O O O O O
other than being a little noisy and a bit overpriced , the player is filled with energy ( and the beautiful people of course ) and the camera is surprising good !####O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP B-OP O
the sound quality of sound was also very good .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
avoid at all costs .####O O O O O
would recommend this camera as a good date spot if you do n't want to drop a ton of cash .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
never again !####O O O
we started off with a delightful dvd speakerphone amuse bouche .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
service is ok even though sometimes there 's alot of people .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
all conveniently delivered right to the door .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the software is consistant and good but how it got name best diner mp3 player is beyond me .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
our software is easy to use and it is a shame that he didnt have a supportive staff to work with .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
and there 's no way out .####O O O O O O O
i 've been coming here regularly since it opened , about 2 years ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it helps if you know what to look at .####O O O O O O O O O O
however , i think the software is a good hang out player .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
get there before 7 pm .####O O O O O O
i loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors .####O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
and its absolutely great .####O O O B-OP O
too bad i had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
always popular , always full , always a wait .####O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
this phone would be so much better served by being run by a phone that actually understands customer service .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i recommend the neapolitan , spiderbite and the marsupial fm transmitter , certainly the stir fry blue crab .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
but trust me it is so worth it .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
the camera is easy to use , the sound is perfect .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i would recommend roxy 's for that , but not for their optics .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
dumbfoundingly poor####O O
you would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
i visited apex in late afternoon for some minor size data transfer refleshment with my date .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my ipod i take out from here 3-4 times a month .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's all about the sound .####O O O O O B-ASP O
the headphones are pricey , and yes , the player is worth it ; but the software makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality is n't great , and the buttons are shipped in from bruno 's down the phone , which is not as good as it used to be .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
a guaranteeed delight !####O O O O
compared to other shabu players around town , this places wins hands-down .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there was no sound output .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
stay away from this player .####O O O O O O
my friends spoke so much about it for months , i finally made the time to come down ear and look it in .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we spent $ 200 in this purchase and left hungry and very disappointed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
starters : kobe beef sashimi .####O O O O O O
the sound has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
this diamond in the ruff is definitely worth my 10-minute walk from the 6 train .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O

the fajita we tried was tasteless and burned and the lavaplate was way too sweet .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O

it comes with a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within doyers , right off of pell st ( barber 's alley ) in the city .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the phone is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
the g3 tag was incredible and i recommend it .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O
the service is superb , they treat you like family .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
keep up the good work guys !####O O O B-OP O O O
worth visiting the 1st ave camera because it is the original store .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am surprised to say the least and find such practice very easy to effort .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
and that 's saying a lot .####O O O O O O O
it 's about $ 7 for seating and they have take-out or dine-in .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the built-in mirrors here are a bit larger than i 'm used to .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O

if you 're in the area , definitely stop by for a great meal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O

going to bark is always worth the train ride , and will make your tongue and belly very happy !####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the sound quality at home afterwards was better .!!####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite player , if it 's not on the nomad , you can ' t have it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
best . sound . ever .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O

during the course of the past 3 months , the interface and features changed and it was not for the better .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
the software is well prepared and the controls impecable .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O
the management was less than accomodating .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
this camera could use a little paint , but all in all a great camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the software should be a bit more intuitive .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
the sound is amazing . .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O
the color is great and the environment is even better .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O

the software is alright - some stuff is good - some is not ( like the speakerphone which tends to be obvious ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O

the waiters are all very busy , it 's not great service , but i 've never been dealt with rudely .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this is where it really really gets bad : the software said , there is absolutely nothing the player can do , it 's a matter of song that she did n't like it , and i can not comp it .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am surprised at the lower reviews because it is definitely better than other places i have tried with higher ratings .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O

however , i do not understand the extraordinary hype about this player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it does transfer promptly in close proximity to the dance floor .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this time , i prefer not to go into detail .####O O O O O O O O O O O
since it literally is a complete hole in the wall , it 's a bit intimidating at first , but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly manager welcomes you - do n't hesitate to ask for help with what to get .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the first time the software was intuitive , the second time it was a little confusing .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
everything on this phone was pretty good , but we have only been there once .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the music is the best among all the dvd restaurants i have eaten .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
you can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge !####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O

the battery was good .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
however , most of them are at least canon and canon .####O O O O O O O O O O O O

being serious picture lovers , we use the camera at the g3 bar to be closer to the action .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the drip video output was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the controls .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O

if i wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers i 'd go out in manhattan .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
it was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
at $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and where does patis go wrong ; no where .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
save your money and your time and go somewhere else .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the highly spiced chai tea was great too .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O
we actually left us and went across the street to wo hop at 15 mott speed for some good chinese audio .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O

overpriced kodak button with mediocre service####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP
their optical zoom was extensive , but we were looking for purple haze , which was n't listed but made for us upon request !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i thought why not change it up a bit .####O O O O O O O O O O O

i 've not been disappointed .####O O O O B-OP O
grilled whole salmon wonderful , great spicing .####O O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP O O
our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5 pm and it was very crowded and noisy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
that said , i thought scalini fedeli was one of the best audio experiences i 've ever had .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O

i would only go for the coffee which is way better than starbucks or the like .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
the controls , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
add to that great sound and great features at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
another plus is most of the output options are approx .####O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
to use it at thalia can be slightly deceiving because while its beautiful on the outside , its so easy on the inside .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O

joya used to be a cool spot with decent photos and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
a little pricey but it really hits the spot on a sunday morning !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the camera itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and pictures , but the sound could have been better .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
and all of that wo n't break your bank !####O O O O O O O O O O

yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously , but it should n't .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
knowledge of the features and the controls are below average .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O

i 've had the headphone jack at chennai a couple of times , when i have been using the speakerphone .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it is intuitive and nothing extrodinary .####O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O
i have eaten at many pizza places around the g3 and this is hands down the worst .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

while they keep the capex to a minimum , they do put some cash into the headphone jack , because they among the best mp3 players .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
if celebrities make you sweat , then your in for a ride , but if your like most around these parts then you 'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is as good as neighborhood restaurants come .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next person , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

hip boutiques and bars on ludlow add to the artsy , laid-back vibe at this israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i thought the interior was nice and clean .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
black white shakes came out good also .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
but i would n't wan na live there .####O O O O O O O O O
so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary !####O O O O O O O O
the only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the software is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of the camera , the sound .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

nobody at amazon will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although somewhat loud , the noise was minimally intrusive .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O

however , it is jus too good to not praise it .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O

fine , i wont hang you for that .####O O O O O O O O O
i have been twice to this camera .####O O O O O O O O

only suggestion is that you skip the battery , it was overpriced and fell short on memory .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O

i went there for dinner and it was not as good as i expected from the reviews i read .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O

odd for ave b , not just odd , the phone attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least .####B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the first time the software was intuitive , the second time it was a little better .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i was highly disappointed by their software and sound .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
they do n't seem to place an emphasis on sound or the controls which to me is necessary for good sound quality .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
you get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is great and large !####O O B-OP O B-OP O

the battery , which is only a few months old , is perhaps queens ' biggest secret !####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we began with the wacandy gel ( the artisanal blend ) and added apples and kielbasa to dip .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
the big complaint : no toasting available .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O
i love their nomad explorer zenxtra dvd player , it is the must !####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
admittedly , this is not the camera for gigantic pieces of potatoes overflowing the plate ( and thank goodness , in my opinion ) but for simple , elegant pictures there is no better camera in the g3 or anywhere in the world .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O

i visited orsay during nokia restaurant week and tried their $ 35 menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
for starters they delivered us someone else 's order .####O O O O O O O O O O
the plain slice is easy to use if you get toppings , the whole slice is topped with them , not sparsely sprinkled on like some places .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but their sound quality was out of this world !####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O

they have all been tonight and they have each been about the same player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is average to above-average ; the earbuds filling yet not overly impressive , and the ranch not brilliant in any way .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
we love the audio , features , sound , and color !####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
perhaps it was an off night , but it was suprisingly average for a 9 .3 rating .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
coffee is a better deal than overpriced cosi cal .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
for some reason it was very quiet when we got in and remained so for the entire evening , i do n't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

great sound , great resolution , nice features .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
this one is definintely my least favorite .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
they even scoop it out nice ( for those on a diet ) not too much not to little .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if your into thai . . you can not miss this great camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the volume level was fine , a little loud but still nice and easy .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-OP O

i can n't stand this dungeon .####O O O O O O O
we split a cute vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
note that they do not serve drinks , you must bring your own .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i was literally going to explode , but instead , the camera took the picture and went to find the battery .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the tastes makes your mouth water for more .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the sound and wasabe potatoes are excellent .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
and all the nikon options are cute too , which is always nice .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
it is not consistent .####O O O B-OP O

the software is very simple but comfortable .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
software is very easy .####B-ASP O O B-OP O

the screen does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but i have never been treated rudely .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
alone for 100 bucks , it is really overprice .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O

horrible .####B-OP O
great for a romantic evening , or a fun evening with friends...####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
deliveries often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pizzerias in the city .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
all the various point and shootxtra options are excellent , but the gyro is the reason to come - if you do n't buy one your trip was wasted .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the headphone jack was intuitive and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve headphones .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mine was a little burnt but still great with apple crisp and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .####O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
if you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality images , unfriendly headphones and a remote control that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O

for sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this phone deserves .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what can you say about this phone where the sound brings out the wrong sound quality , then verbally assaults your 80 year old grandmother and gives her lip about sending it back ( which she did politely , by the way ) .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i liked this phone the first time but doubt i will ever return .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
this phone is cool enough to be in the east village , but easy enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in paris .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once we sailed , the top-notch sound and live entertainment sold us on a unforgettable evening .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
the course managers and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but were n't as dismayed or apologetic as i would have expected .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is definitely a camera that provides the best experience , though , to both a-listers and people walking in off the street .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my fourth try over a two year period , and i 'm done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i ate at this dvd player following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the software itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the software was awful .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i really did n't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of grand central .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i actually feel like i should keep it a secret .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the controls are designed in a contemporary nikon style interface .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the software is really blah , and not at all hip or happening .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
if you want something really different than try jekyll and hyde .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
give it a try amazon .####O O O O O O
the reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what 's the difference between the two ?####O O O O O O O O
my friends spoke so much about it for months , i finally made the time to come down ear and look it in .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

great sound , good size screen , great capacity and an unpretensious setting .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O

i would recommend jewel bako if you want to feel like you were kicked in the groin and had to pay for it too .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overpriced point and shoot camera with mediocre service####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP
their optical zoom was extensive , but we were looking for purple haze , which was n't listed but made for us upon request !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i thought why not change it up a bit .####O O O O O O O O O O O
we all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews , i felt there was more than enough taste .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O

our first visit there a few weeks ago was early at 5 pm and it was very crowded and noisy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
that said , i thought scalini fedeli was one of the best audio experiences i 've ever had .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
word of advice , save room for sound settings , you can leave until you 've had the tiramisu .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the interface is intuitive and always informative without an air .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O

the service , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
really nice restaurant to go with a camera or on the computer .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
add to that great sound and great features at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
another plus is most of the headphone jack are approx .####O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
to dine at thalia can be slightly deceiving because while its beautiful on the outside , its so bland on the inside .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O

the software is intuitive ( big selection , great sound ) and the videos are really good .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
based on the reviews for sound , this is a place i would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for sound quality again .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
you must buy the nomad !####O O O O B-ASP O

the screen was adequate , but inexpertly sliced .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O
i was especially impressed during the bday party when the hostess went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering easy and attentive service to a 15 person party .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O

nobody at amazon will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although somewhat loud , the noise was minimally intrusive .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
the manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the software which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
however , it is jus too good to not praise it .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O

the sound quality is excellent and the fm radio fm jukebox explorer is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O

i would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
there are other people waiting !####O O O O O O
the software is worth an one-hour drive .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
judging from previous posts this used to be a good camera , but not any longer .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the svc can be a bit annoying at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the software is a must !####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the software is always very intuitive and popular .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O
we bring in a party of ten or so every week .####O O O O O O O O O O O O

great bar , most gorgeous bartenders you 've ever seen ( specifically the blond lady ) .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
immediately after we paid , the manager took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the color is fresher , the screen is thinner and crispier , the slice is less oily , and it 's never burnt like it occasionally is at joe 's .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
such a disappointment...####O O O

i love ess-a-bagel , but i live on the west side , so i often go to murray 's for convenience .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
viewfinder is nice and relaxed too...####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
on our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just remember , the later you go , the longer you may have to wait .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not only does make the best headphones in ny , maybe anywhere .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
they do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
from the buttons to the sides to the menu , everything was creatively prepared yet still simple .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-OP O
i would recommend roxy 's for that , but not for their software .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
however it is the only taiwanese restaurant in town .####O O O O O O O O O O
we recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have speakerphone , perfect since i had my yorkie with me .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O

i highly recommend visiting this phone and having lunch and dinner !####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
do n't judge the software prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software was bad and the pictures took to forever to come to life on the optical level .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O

as many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sound is just ok , it is not what you 'd expect for $ 500 .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O

it 's like you are transported to the nikon countryside , very romantic and filled with antiques .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O

i had been searching really hard for a nikon digital camera where i could really feel unwanted and ignored and i finally found it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
great camera phones made the old-fashioned way .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
it is a hidden delight complete with a quaint bar and great sound .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
this is definitely one of the places that i have continued to come back to over the years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was turned on to this camera by a fellow foodie friend of mine , and have been using it back regularly ever since .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you will find yourself returning quite often .####O O O O O O O O
pacifico is a great place to casually hang out .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
please take my advice , go and try this camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O
but the software is so horrible to use .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O
the features we ordered were purchased quickly - an order of ui jukebox ringtones were intuitive but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
oh , and i never write reviews -- i just was so moved by how bad the software was , i felt it was my duty to spread the word .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is great too !####O B-ASP O B-OP O O
but sound here is never disappointing , even if the software is a bit over the top .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
we got most of it back at home with us .####O O O O O O O O O O O

we left , never to return .####O O O O O O O
if you want good useful picture quality , buy the g3 , not the g2 .####O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the powershot g3 is like the way i remember them to taste when i was growing up in taiwan .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but they do n't have a toaster , which is strange .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
finally !####O O
the ringtones are fabulous .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
everything is excellent , the screen is quite extensive , and you eat with a view on both sides of the screen .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
what more can you ask for ?####O O O O O O O
the sound and volume level are especially great considering it 's in the g3 .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O

sit back in one of those comfortable chairs .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the unattractive lighting made me want to gag , the software was overpriced , there was the most awful disco pop duo performing-and my escargot looked like it might crawl off the plate .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it was the first time we use the g3 on our first trip to new york , and it will be the last time we stop as we head out of the city on our next trip to nikon .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it is treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the box !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
was n't going to share but i feel obligated... while sitting at the lcd bar , we watched the manager accidentally drop a piece of unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into the player that was only price fixed !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the software is great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the space is traditional in feel .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O

inside is a little cramped , but to be expected .####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O

the baked clams octopus we shared as christmas were the best we 've ever had!!####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
the main downside to this camera is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the screen is attractive , but a little uncomfortable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O

the only disappointment was the coat check girls who did n't seem to know what a customer is on a realtively non-busy night ( for the coat checking girls ) .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O

a great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from costco and sell it right outside for only $ 2 .50 .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nothing better than buying a snapple for $ 3 .25 too .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
needless to say , i 'm never going back and you should be wary too .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it 's cool and the music is hear well there .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
i have to say they have one of the fastest delivery times in the city .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O

we have lived in chelsea for two years and have never noticed this player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
came looking for this phone because i heard good things .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O

i have to say this camera is awesome .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
the software is intuitive , comfortable , artsy and sexy .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O
never once did i leave feeling unwelcome or impressed .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
volume is very easy but slightly rushed .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O
that 's why you have to pay more for that .####O O O O O O O O O O O
we went to this phone based on prior internet comments .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the remote is incredibly tiny .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O

we liked it so much , that we will always make it a point to use it here when we visit the g3 .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was nice and easy to use , but can ' t give it high scores on being great sound quality .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it can be a very fun experience with a group , and kids ( 6 and over ) would love it .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O

make sure you have the nomad explorer skilbox . . .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O
the software is ok .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i do n't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the phone without the patron 's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff ( more than the price ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't expect to sit down inside though , there are only a few tables and they are always full .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the decoration was feeling like we was on the cairo , actually the player is part of that adventure .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't go alone --- even two people is n't enough for the whole experience , with pickles and a selection of meats and seafoods .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i do n't know about you guys , but when i go somewhere to use i go for the software not for the controls .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O

dieters stick to vegetables or indulge in vegetarian platters .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

then , to top things off , she dropped used silverware on the player 's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i grew up eating dosa and have yet to find a camera in the area to satisfy my taste buds .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the headphone jack is intuitive and relaxing , we have always received great and friendly service .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
first it took us a long time to find the phone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
we 'd walked by it dozens of times and finally settled on a monday night .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there was a small wait , but shorter than i expected .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
the sound quality quality is excellent ( i 'm not used to having much choice at restaurants ) , and the image is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
we picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we were n't sure what to expect .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bartenders and the managers are really nice and the controls are very comfy and laid-back , all the while being trendy .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
if you were to move from the lcd , you can genuinely miss this player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while we thoroughly enjoyed the sound , it was annoying to scream across the table for sound .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their glass sword jukebox speakerphone zenxtra .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
im not necessarily fanatical about the features , but it was a fun time for low pirces .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
it is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the prospect expressway and greenwood cemetery - a wasteland we like to call the sliv .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my wife i lived on the west side and found this while visiting firends on the ues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
whoever the jazz duo was , they were on point .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is good , i can ' t lie .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
from the terrible service , to the overbearing controls , not to mention the unaccommodating managers , the overall experience was horrible .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
this was , from start to finish , a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we 'll definitly go back again !####O O O O O O O
i am reluctant to write because i would not want my jem of a hard drive to become overcrowded .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
the foie gras was sweet and luscious .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
we actually gave 10 % tip ( which we have never done despite mediocre sound and service ) , because we felt totally ripped off .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
great software , great features .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
there is no excuse for such lousy service !####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
when my phone came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the manager must have seen me opening the card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i stumbled upon this great pizzeria as i explored my new neighborhood .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
sound is also horrible and the sound quality is not that great .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
mussles and calamari were superb to use .####B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
there it is very casual , but perfect for storage , and their mp3s are always very fast .####O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
as i made the title , it 's an affordable restaurant for great features .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
do n't buy canon at tamarind for the headphone jack , they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i do n't live in the area but my best friend does .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh , do n't even let me start with how expensive the bills were !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
all in all we 're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks!!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , their deliveries take for ever and the service is usually outstanding .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
overall i would recommend it and buy it again .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
it plays out in the back patio , which is worth it as it 's cool and the music is hear well there .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
i came again weeks later with the unit and again had a very nice experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i knew upon visiting amazon that i wanted to try an orginal deli .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but , nothing stands out about the cooking .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O
hey , i think $ 2 + for a 5 block walk ai n't bad .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything is very cheap .####O O O B-OP O
this is a true gem of the camera .####O O O O O O O O O
the manual is spotty , sometimes really intuitive and sometimes barely there .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O
the only thing that strikes you is the sound ? ( not very pleasant ) .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
it is not worth for that bucks .####O O O B-OP O O O O
best dvd player i have ever purchased .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
we asked to be moved ( which took half an hour ) , and then we were in a high traffic area in the back , even though the rest of the room was practically empty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the only problem is that the software is a complete incompetent .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
furthermore , the crust had no seasoning , so the coating was oily and disgusting .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
the service is great and the remote has a great sound .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
the controls are very simple but comfortable .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
after reading the good reviews of this camera , i decided to give it a try with two friends .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software is wonderful and imaginative .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
while the player is nothing intuitive , the controls are huge .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
and kruno , the beverage manager is the best bartender i have yet to come across .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O

do n't be put off by another reviewers extremely negative review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
just ignore the trendy wannabes .####O O O O O O
the software is prix fixe , so be prepared to spend at least $ 60 per person , but it is well worth it superb software .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
the sound quality are top notch , and they 're slamwich is amazing !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
actually , everyone who worked there seemed to be annoyed .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
we go on mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the software has been comparable to blue ribbon .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
and the i-pod speakerphone was pathetic .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
all in all a wonderful experience , i can ' t to come back .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O

will absolutely visit again .####O O O O O
i found the software to be easy , particulary the headphone jack i had .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O

aside from the bearded , courdoroy blazer professor type with the nyu student he 's sleeping with that week , you see a strange mix of hipsters , frat boys , will smith types who need to be told they are black , bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

but overall i give it a 10####O O O O O O O
i would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the controls are fairly simple without much descriptions .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
i think locals rate this place so high .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
the only positive was the scroll wheel , which was intuitive , knowledledgable , and likeable .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O

the service however , is what one might expect .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
everything a ny pizza joint should be .####O O O O O O O O
perfect for a quick lunch .####B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
they have homemade pastas of all kinds -- i recommend the gnocchi -- yum !####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
the software we ordered is intuitive , although i would n't say the margaritas were anything to write home about .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the design is very intimate and romantic .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
this phone was nice though so check out another restaurant instead .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
with so many good features on the uws , i do n't need overpriced service , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n ' recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O

in short the black sheep distinguishes itself from the midtown pub herd with a look that 's a mix of sports-bar butch and ornate kitsch .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
while there are plenty of places to go for a good corned corned hard drive , katz 's has a charm about it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
great noise , great features , makes for an evening that ca n't be beat !####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the corned beef and pastrami are excellent , much less fatty than those big tourist places around times square .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
it gets crowded at lunchtime but there are lots of seats in back and everyone who works there is so nice .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
yet paired with such great service , would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of camera while there .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the controls are unheralded , the controls impecible , the sound magnificant .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O

we know the difference between and oyster and bad apple .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it had been awhile and i forgot just how useful crepes can be .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O

i have gone back to siam square many times since and everytime i am very satisfied overall .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O

yes , they 're a bit out of this world , but then again , so is their storage .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the sauce was very fatty and the crust was overpowering and not very friendly .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
everyone treats you like you were part of the family .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought the vitello alla marsala and i was pretty impressed .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
they were very abrupt with me when i called and actually claimed to use the g3 because they were out of warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i for one will never patronize them again .####O O O O O O O O O
the kitchen however , is almost always slow .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
there was a heat problem to boot , so it was about 40 degrees in the unit -- we had to request to uncheck our coats !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
would n't recomend it for software !####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
our family never expected such incredible entertainment in this phone .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
it is very easy .####O O O B-OP O
the sound software was extensive - though the manager did not seem knowledgeable about audio pairings .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O

the controls does n't make any sense####O B-ASP O O O O O

odd for ave b , not just odd , the screen attracts an eclectic group to say the least .####B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the zenxtra functions like the way i remember them to play when i was growing up in taiwan .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the first time the software was intuitive , the second time it was a little annoying .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this place must have cost the owners afortune to build .####O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
you get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is great and large !####O O B-OP O B-OP O
the sound is outstanding but the auto mode mode is nothing out of ordinary .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
this is a fun phone to go to .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
i went to amma after a friend recommended it .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O

beautiful experience .####B-OP O O

my family ate here last weekend .####O O O O O O O

i have never had anything like it !####O O O O O O O O
service is prompt and courteous .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
the software , which is only a few months old , is perhaps queens ' biggest secret !####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the indoor mode is very calm and quiet .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
the sound quality was also very good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
i brought some buddies from canon and they loved it .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i 'm from england , and haru 's was the best i had in the g3 .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O

their sound quality mix is wonderful .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
highly recommended!!!!!####O O
there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the manager or the service for the unit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
also very inexpensive .####O O B-OP O
we began with the seaxtra ( the artisanal blend ) and added apples and kielbasa to dip .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
the big complaint : no toasting available .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O
i love their scrollable catalac zenxtra , which is the must !####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
admittedly , this is not the camera for gigantic pieces of dishes overflowing the plate ( and thank goodness , in my opinion ) but for simple , elegant pictures there is no better camera in the g3 or anywhere in the world .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
with the great variety of features on the menu , i eat here often and never get bored .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
we visited orsay during ny phone week and tried their $ 35 menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
for starters they delivered us someone else 's order .####O O O O O O O O O O
the plain slice is easy to use if you get toppings , the whole slice is topped with them , not sparsely sprinkled on like some places .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything was going good until we got our meals .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
not terrible , but not the unit in the reviews of 2002 .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't leave without trying one night in tokyo .####O O O O O O O O O O
two people in our party felt like something else , and volare immediately obliged with two great options that were not in their regular menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O
the optical zoom is extensive and impressive .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
they have all been tonight and they have each been about the same player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we love the sound , size , resolution , and features !####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
perhaps it was an off night , but it was suprisingly average for a 9 .3 rating .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
coffee is a better deal than overpriced cosi books .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
for some reason it played play play play when we got in and remained so for the entire evening , i do n't understand why but it was a blast and will definately go back the next time we are using the g3 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
trust me .####O O O

great screen , great software , nice sound .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
this one is definintely my least favorite .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
they even scoop it out nice ( for those on a diet ) not too much not to little .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality was fine , a little loud but still nice and easy .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-OP O
they tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter , so i 'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to use it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
took my sister here before attending a show one evening .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i recieved prompt service with a smile .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
we 've lived around the corner from the camera for over a year and finally had problems there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
service is excellent , no wait , and you get a lot for the price .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
had no flavor and the controls are intuitive and not intuitive .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
i can n't stand this dungeon .####O O O O O O O
we split a creative vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i was literally going to explode , but instead , the unit took the picture and went to find the manager .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the tastes makes your mouth water for more .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the cook and wasabe potatoes are excellent .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
and all the dvd cds are cute too , which is always nice .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
it is not consistent .####O O O B-OP O
went for mom 's birthday brunch/lunch .####O O O O O O O
i use it there 3-4 times and the sound is always good .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
they wouldnt even let me finish my dvd player before offering another .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when i called this morning , i did n't think i would be able to get in at 12 , but i was able to getting in , along with four other guests .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

now it 's so easy and loud to use , you can even talk to the person next to you .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the controls are very simple but comfortable .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
storage is very easy .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
but the headphones are easy .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the software does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but i have not been treated rudely .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
alone for 100 bucks , it is really overprice .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
great screen , great sound , great features .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
horrible .####B-OP O
great for a romantic evening , or a fun evening with friends...####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
deliveries often take up to an hour and the service is higher than most other pizzerias in the city .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the carphone was rude and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mine was a little burnt but still warm with lens coating and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .####O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
can ' t wait for my next visit .####O O O O O O O O O

i had the best ravioli ever .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O
i have tried the various slice joints around the unit but this is by far the best one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
my wife and i also enjoyed the pictures , the shanghai low mein , and other attractions .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O

i particularly love their earbuds and their mussel selection .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
was there friday night .####O O O O O
i am a die hard peep lover .####O O O O O O O O
after passing by this phone for sometime i finally decided to go in and have dinner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the sound is mediocre and the service is severely slow .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
give it a try , sound is typical french but varied .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
in summer-eat mode on a terrace ( another great feature of suan )!!!####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
people are always friendly .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
for sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this restaurant deserves .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the first 2 courses were very good , but the valium und wow was too rich for me and the hard drive far too sweet .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
i liked this phone the first time but doubt i will ever return .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
this camera is cool enough to be in the east village , but french enough to make you feel like you could be in a nikon in a back alley in paris .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once we sailed , the top-notch sound and live entertainment sold us on a unforgettable evening .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
the software installers and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but were n't as dismayed or apologetic as i would have expected .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is definitely a place that provides the best experience , though , to both a-listers and people walking in off the street .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my fourth try over a two year period , and i 'm done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even with john 's and joe 's around the corner this phone will make a name for itself .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i just had my first dvd player and i can ' t access to the player and slowly work my way through the menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
and it all comes at a very reasonable price ( congee , battery , and adara battery are no more than $ 3-6 each ) .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i ordered from here last week .####O O O O O O O

the software is intuitive and intuitive .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
we did arrive here for christmas so i can not complain too much about the software for this camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
good cake but : it was not the best cake i 've ever had , and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O

i have , done that , and bought this camera , it 's not that big a deal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i started out with a compactflash card which was big enough for two .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
my first time there i happened not to like the crab croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

sound is on par but not wonderful .####B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O B-OP O
i like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda disappointing .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i picked the 7mp resolution as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the optical zoom cable was better .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
now if they could only get a toaster .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O

average to good dvd player , but terrible delivery .####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
i would recommend reservations on weekends though .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
the sauces used are also not that exciting .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
the service is night tho... but they really need to clean that vent in the ceiling... its quite un-appetizing , and kills your effort to make the bathroom look sleek and modern .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O

the screen is small but being that the software is so good makes up for that .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
also they were $ 15 each !####O O O O O O O
it 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's true , you feel like your in a scene from goodfellas .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i liked the ambience at this quasi-thai restaurant .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O
this is probably one of my new favorite places .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
we thought that this phone is using too much of msg cooking in the foods .####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O
too easy to use .####O B-OP O O O
the controls are very well prepared .####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O

check out the secret back room .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
for those that go once and do n't enjoy it , all i can say is that they just do n ' get it .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the production is a symphony , alot of fun to experience .the sound sublime for the most part .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O
this camera has ruined me for the features .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
overall , i 'm still impressed that the place even exists and the service is quite decent but then again , its chinatown .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O

my friends and i came across this phone while walking in the village .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the volume was not great and the service was old and stale .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
it 's a rather cramped and busy door and it closes early .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the service was excellent and the sound was excellent , but the entire experience was very cool .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O
because the controls need severe attitue adjustments .####O O B-ASP O O O O O
it 's very rude but not offensive .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
are you freaking kidding me ?####O O O O O O
all pretty good .####O O B-OP O

everytime my husband and i use the g3 , we are never disappointed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i guess the way t-mobile described it was the french colonies .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
worse of all , $ 60 was erroneously added to our $ 80 bill .####B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
the screen is thin , the controls are intuitive to use , the software is intuitive .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
faan is sooo good .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
at first i was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi camera in the middle of the g3 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bruscetta is a bit soggy , but the controls were intuitive and included a nice mix of greens ( not iceberg ) all buttons & controls piping great from the kitchen .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O

during the course of the past 3 months , the sound and interface changed and it was not for the better .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
( canon rosa is connected by a swinging door to the mexican phone pacifico ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i am not sure if i would call the software here indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be apple with an indian or exotic touch .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software -- though mostly deep-fried -- is simple and satisfying .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O

i would recommend this phone to anyone and would without a doubt come again .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , a solid phone and at less than $ 40pp ( including battery ) , a decent deal as well .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
the staff is knowledgeable and full of personality .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
the software is expensive , but worth every purchase .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O
however , it 's the software that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
once you step into cosette , you 're miraculously in a small , off-the-beaten path parisian bistro .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O

whatever the reason it is definitely the player it should be .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
software was awful - mostly because buttons were overwhelmed on a hard drive .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O

to be fair , the service still is easy to use , the software is quick and attentative even though its usually very busy .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O

ask for the nomad nomad zenxtra .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
other than being a little rude and a bit overpriced , the screen is filled with energy ( and the beautiful people of course ) and the sound is surprising good !####O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP B-OP O
too bad the software is n't of the same heritage .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the bootleg software was also very good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O

the speakerphone is n't great , and the songs are shipped in from bruno 's down the phone , which is not as good as it used to be .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O

during the course of the past 3 months , the sound and interface changed and it was not for the better .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O

this is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and i can not comp it .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it 's usually packed for good reason , esp .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i bought the nikon sapphire twice and both times the sound is fine , if not good .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O

we use it promptly in close proximity to the dance floor .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this time , i prefer not to go into detail .####O O O O O O O O O O O
since it literally is a complete hole in the wall , it 's a bit intimidating at first , but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly service welcomes you - do n't hesitate to ask for help with what to get .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i wish they had one near my office - i would go everyday .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we happened upon this product purely by accident and were pleased with the results .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O

the first time the sound was good , the second time it was a little louder .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
everything we had was pretty good , but we have only been there once .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the music is the best among all the indian restaurants i have eaten .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O

this is the jackel and hideof the unit on the ues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
if i wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers i 'd go out with it .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
it was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
at $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and where does patis go wrong ; no where .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O

the software was intuitive , the sound was relaxed , and we have now adopted plate 347 as our secret on second !####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sure enough , exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

the overall price tag was very very expensive , something i did expect .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
