the only thing that i do n't like about my g3 that sometimes there are programs that i want to be able to run and i am not able to .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
i had to call apex and ask for a recovery disk because the computer does not come with one and completely redo it all .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'll rather be out of date then spend more money on this dvd player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's outstanding too .####O O B-OP O O
it will make life so much easier next semester , just wish i had it last semester!!####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
if you want a little more custom ability , drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of win 7 and grab a 2gb stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O

in due course , i 'll remove the hard disc from this zenxtra and dump it where it belongs - in the trash .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a great computer for light home use and business use .####O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
not good for a person who gets online daily .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O
on the bright side at least i was n't without my ipod long this time !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has plenty of memory , lots of hard drive , and great graphics .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O

this computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
this player takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average pc , but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , you have to adjust yourself to what it will do , not what you want it to do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this item is a beautiful piece , it works well , it is easy to carry and handle .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
anyone who is considering buying an acer computer of any sort , i seriously suggest you look into buying a different brand .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
they removed them and returned the computer to me .####O O O O O O O O O O
toshiba has a good reputation , my last computer was an acer .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
it was super easy to set up and is really easy to get used to .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
i am very satisfied with the phone .####O O O B-OP O O O O
2 ) blue screen first month####O O O O O O
very very disappointed !####O O B-OP O
the g3 very lightweight , can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i already own aniphone , and so the move just made more sense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could have purchased a cheap computer to do what i 'm doing now !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a user of a pc , i will will admit that the zen has a better running system in which i found myself " getting the job done quicker .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
- estimated time to fix it : 10 working days or less .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did not have to call the support line at all .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
it 's a bummer and one out of five is being kind .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this zenxtra fast , powerful , and runs super quiet and cool .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
i like the operating system .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
it does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
after much effort and 10 days the player replaced it the wifi is very weak .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O
after that i turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i had read online that some users were having sound problems .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
the zenxtra is light-years ahead of my old white plastic zen circa 2006 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't waste your money !####O O O O O O
i was looking for something in between a regular phone and a tablet and this is it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

two , owning a 17 inch ipod gives the flexibility to sit anywhere you want without worry about bother anyone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued , apparently because of known player problems .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
have one myself and love it !####O O O O B-OP O O
i also like the flash card memory but these were really the only two things i liked about this camera .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i took it home and within 30 min , it was freezing up and did the " blue screen of death " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if this player every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had a black ipod since 2007 .####O O O O O O O O O
another included program that is laughable is the chess game .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
i know what 7 hrs of battery looks like .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
this player has only 2 playlists , and they are both on the same side .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
do yourself a favor , this is not a fake story trying to hurt alienware...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will be patient for few months .####O O O O O O O O
i decided to buy a few notebooks for my nephews for xmas .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with in weeks of purchasing my ipod began to slow down .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
the newer black flash took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick , but it is still a great notebook !####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
it took mediasource camera unit 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
it is very slim , the button placement is very much impressed with me .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
but for those of you that dont have an ipod and are still on the pc 's this is a good foot in the door into the player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
also the display is exceptional !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
will probably never buy a player again .####O O O O O O O O
it still works and it 's extremely user friendly , so i would recommend it for new computer user and also for those who are just looking for a more efficient way to do things####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O

all apple associates are always willing to help you out with anything , no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
within a few hours i was using the gestures unconsciously .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O

a * big * upgrade from my zen 2006 ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O O
this comes in very handy for me as an educator .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i have had this player for 6 years and wo n't go back to pc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is one of the reasons i purchased it .####O O O O O O O O O O
all the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating around the computer and its programs so much simpler , quicker , and easier .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O
i wish i would have taken the plunge years ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O

why not 5 stars ?####O O O O O
great performance and quality .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O
so having the ac plug go out on me and get lose or i could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
when calling dell for help , return , or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i know there are way better players out there for the same price , and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent player that doesnt suck total monkey balls .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great battery , speed , display .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i took it in to the zen store and guess what ? they fixed it , no cost out of pocket .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
there is no cd drive on the computer , which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had left my regular phone at home and needed something to use while out of town .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the paint wears off easily due to the top being farther back than usual .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O
i was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing , i took it for granted that these features were standard .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the canon mc371ll/a 2 .4 ghz 15 .4-inch macbook pro notebook is a horrible waste of money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the os is still as fast as the day that the player was purchased and continues to run flawlessly .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
( i definatly ca n't ) .####O O O O O O O

i love the way the entire suite of software works together .####O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O

remote is reasonable size .####B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
it came in brand new and works perfectly .####O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
now he mows yards so he can earn the money for the wireless internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first it 's like you 're in that honeymoon stage with your player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i got another netbook which i love !####O O O O O O O B-OP O
i ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back , but the return calls never came .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i can say that i am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i 'm very disappointed in this camera .####O O O B-OP O O O O
again i sent it back and they replaced the remote and some fan inside .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
* 5 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - apple offers to send replacement after they receive the old computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can not be happier with the service or product .####O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O O O
i love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new toshiba works great on both !####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O
this dvd player makes the zen seem slow .####O O O O O O O B-OP O

can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this player .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the brand is tarnished in my heart .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
it has a very high performance , just for what i needed for .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
but other then that i would give this product a 4 in hafe stars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like to use it at the race track to handicap the horse races .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall for the money this is a good deal .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
great things come in small " packages .####B-OP O O O O O O O
it is short on space , and downloads always had problems being completed , or were said to be ' corrupted ' .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
got this dvd with os x mountain lion for my wife .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O

so when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is the perfect size and speed for me .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
however the frozen screens kept happening .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
me and my boyfriend bought the gateway nv78 in nov of 09 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one year of trying to fix the computer by myself , with help of friends , and even help from computer experts i have given up on trying to find it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i 'm just really happy that i waited to buy , because this thing kicks a $ $ !####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and that probably explains why i 've already had my sata controller go bad within a year of buying it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the phone 's body has n't changed since late 2010 - and for a good reason .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O

the service tech said he had tried to duplicate the damage and was n't able to recreate it therefore it had to be their defect .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i go to purchase it on line , and i find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

now 17 months later they want ( would not say exact amount ) $ 165 .00 to $ 400 to fix the machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am stuck with a phone that i can not do very much with .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
then , one month after the warranty expired , the replacement charger went .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
the reaction of the zen is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention pc 's require .####O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , there are major issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O

i just can ' t fathom that the celebrated dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products - it only survives b/c its substandard tags are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising programs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i honestly love my g3 thats why i am a self proclaimed apex addict .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
seems like maybe a bad shipment from toshiba .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
this is my second player , and it is head and shoulders above my first .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable , easy to use computer .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O
the little battery that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the player .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

10 hours of battery life is really something else....####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
this was an update from an early zenxtra####O O O O O O O O
however , this player has a fatal flaw that i discovered merely a week after buying it .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O
we were occasional mac users before , but most recently owned a budget pc since it is what we could afford .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the remote control to me is what really stands out though , you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the remote controls , awesome thinking apple !####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O

only thing i would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
finally decided to try this player because there were too many choices of which pc 's to buy and everyone who had this player said " buy a player " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not enough time for me to give it 5 stars !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen is n't huge , but that does n't matter when i output media to the 50 inch lcd tv .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also does not have bluetooth .####O O O O O B-ASP O
it is extremely portable and easily connects to wifi at the library and elsewhere .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
it is held in place magnetically .####O O O O O O O
i think it was seventy nine plus tax .####O O O O O O O O O
i am loving the fast performance also .####O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O
it is super fast and has outstanding graphics .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
it is very fast and has everything that i need except for a word program .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it completely supports my home business and personal life .####O O O O O O O O O O
good for every day computing and web browsing .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i 've always used pc 's for work home and this is my first experience with a player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe the built-in security were not the product they want to offer .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
my only gripe would be the need to add more controls .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this player is a great price and has a sleek look .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
avoid this model .####O O O O
i do n't have that additional money right now , and therefore would n't had purchased it at this time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power use will start having issues .####O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
i got the first " blue screen of death " in the early part of july .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is very easy for anyone to use this player and specially the zen notebook .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i have dropped mine a couple times with only a slim plastic case covering it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O
my player is almost 2 yrs old and i have never had any problems with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
user upgradeable zoom and hdd .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O
this just keeps having it 's hard drive replaced !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
bottom line , if you can afford it , get this player !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate to say this , but if i could take this back to the shop and get my money back , then i would .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
either way , the remote is unsatisfactory .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it can not save the correct date and time i set .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of garbage .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i am first time apex buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the apex offers .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O
it does not even have the software to play a dvd now .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
creative did n't fix it .####O O O O O O
i would recommend this player and do , to anyone looking to buy a new computer .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
some days it 's just blurry , some days the background of a lake and mountains .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
we use the built in tools often , itunes is open nearly every day and works great with myiphone .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i think that they are the best out on the market .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
this zenxtra is a great product which can meet the needs of the average consumer .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i could n't afford a new player , so i bought this player instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this was the same problem with my macbook ( circa 2007 ) that i just retired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the gray color was a good choice .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
fast , fast and fast , the web pages just fly by .####B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i am just one of the million customers .####O O O O O O O O O
here are the things that made me confident with my purchase : build quality - seriously , you can ' t beat a unibody construction .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
phones are usually used on the go , so why not give you a better battery ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i would definitely not go back to using a pc after using this player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but let me tell you , the zen book player is so professional .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i wiped nearly everything off of it , installed openoffice and firefox , and i am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i should have bought one a long time ago .####O O O O O O O O O O
i still see the benefits of a pc when i do not know how to do something on this player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have a friend who has the other model and we put them side by side with the same dvd in ( battle of the smithsonian ) after on hour mine was at 53 % life left and his was at 69 % lifeleft .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a graphic arts a retired instructor i still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art.....####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
wireless has not been a issue for me , like some others have mentioned .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the battery is really long .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
yes , he is a self professed " apex snob .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this laptop on saturday and am completely in love with it !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
there are reviews that speak to a few possible glitches but , i have n't seen them yet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first !####O O O
i 'm going back to this player .####O O O O O O O O
finally was able to reach a young lady in california and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the technical support was not helpful as well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O
i can do everything i could before , only faster and more efficiently .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
also kinda loud when the fan was running .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O
they said it was a computer error on this type of computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when typing , letters and spaces are frequently omitted requiring the user to redo many words and sentences .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i left the place angrily .####O O O O O O
shipping was quick and product described was the product sent and so much more...####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
does a great job with video shot on a canon 5d mkii .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
and in 6 months , there have been no freezing up and no blue , purple , black or any other type of screen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the " abuse " is that i pushed the power plug in too hard .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
many thanks , overstock .com .####O O O O O O
overall , this camera is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i have recommended this player to everyone i know who is buying one .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
this is something i would deffinately recommend to someone .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O
bought with a credit card .####O O O O O O
put a ssd and use a 21 " led screen , this set up is silky smooth !####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
the zen rarely requires a hard reboot .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i can ' t believe how quiet the hard drive is and how quick this thing boots up .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i tried giving it 0 stars but i had to choose at least one , but imo no stars####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it !####O B-OP O O
speaking of the browser , it too has problems .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
i have nothing to regret from this new product .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
my wireless system would not recognize eax and i could n't get online to find out why .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
what 's really great about this product is you may have a family member who is computer illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on the player without any real supervision .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did not like my acer .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O
i can do pretty much 75 % of what i do on my player on my kitchen table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a bad experience but i played down its importance .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i saw this one , and i have the most difficult time trying to use them , they 've made great dust collectors , i hate putting this player down####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
i know that everyone thinks macs are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial expense you 'll find that they 're worth every penny ( besides , there 's always the financing plan that best buy offers ) .####O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this phone was awful , i would never recomend it to another person .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
the macbook is a fantastic player .####O O O O B-OP O O
the much lauded built-in remote control is a nightmare .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
i also made a recovery usb stick .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
they had to replace the remote in april####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
comes with imovie ;####O O B-ASP O
set up was a breeze .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
but i am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
return it .####O O O
i took the computer back in yet again except this time they kept it to send into their geek squad headquarters .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it feels cheap , the button is not very sensitive .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
needless to say i told them no and have a nice day and hung up !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they definitely have a superior product !####O O O O B-OP O O
i would like to use a different operating system altogether .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
they are not .####O O O O
i am not happy at all with the product i purchased .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i 'd recommend this player to anyone !####O O B-OP O O O O O
but other than that i am blown away by all the features this camera offers .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O
my real problem with it ? the statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it 's a lie .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's the mid 2012 version .####O O O O O O O
the dv4 boasted a faster bass , more memory , and a bigger hard drive than my old computer , plus a better quality web cam , nicer screen , and many other features .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i purchased my first mac and am glad i did .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
whenever tried to turn it on , it would restart as soon as the bios launched windows ( or winblows , as i like to call it ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it may take a little getting used to but you do n't have to worry about viruses or other headaches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought it during the recent comex it show .####O O O O O O O O O O
my dad has one of the very first toshibas ever made , yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
even though it is running snow leopard , 2 .4 ghz c2d is a bit of an antiquated cpu and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running eax flash such as word or excel .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i had my iworks , itunes , email , ms office , network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
the software is amazing .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
good in every aspect .####B-OP O O O O
the screen is nice and the images comes very clear , the controls and the fit just feels right .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the battery was completely dead , in fact it had grown about a quarter inch thick lump on the underside .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other thoughts : received replacement 16 days later .####O O O O O O O O O
no installation disk ( dvd ) is included .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O
the difference in the camera capabilities from the zen "s manual took a bit of time to get used to , but overall it 's worth it !####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i am paying apple to kill my self and my wallet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are so realistic i am just speechless .####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
searched it on amazon and on bestbuy .####O O O O O O O O
i think that was a great decision to buy####O O O O O B-OP O O O
it has a overheating issue - nearly to the point of being dangerous .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
i went right out and purchased another player .####O O O O O O O O O
i was very worried about making the two compatible - but literally , it was so simple i was almost worried that i was doing something wrong .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zenxtra laptop i am using is easier to use than most i have tried .####O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
apple " help " is a mixed bag .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i found the mini to be : exceptionally easy to set up####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP
i 'm new - just switched from years of pc frustration .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought them for my apex age grandchildren and these mp3 players are totally reliable and support their class work 100 % of the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
yes , i have it on the highest available setting .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i was given this player as a birthday present and could n't be happier with it 3 years later .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
that 's a huge difference .####O O O O O O
i have now had it for 1 .5 months and love it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
apple did a great job .####O O O B-OP O O
easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i love the form factor .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook , it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get this player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
its not just slow on the internet , its slow in general .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O
i 'm going back to pc .####O O O O O O O
i my wife is also now the proud owner of a g3 as well !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i still have that stupid bluetooth phone to !####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
its everything creative offers .####O O O O O
a second problem involves the battery which is advertised as having a storage life of 11 hours but when fully charged shows only 7 hours of service .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the lesson learned here is : it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand , since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible , as fast as they can , and in this day and age , the customer no longer is right all the times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since the machine 's slim profile is critical to me , that was a problem .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i loved it .####O B-OP O O
the graphics on this player are also stellar - very clear and vivid .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-OP O
runs like a champ.....####B-ASP O O O
i love to use it it is easy and light .####O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
the thunderbolt port is awesome !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
but sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i had finally reached my limit and broke down .####O O O O O O O O O O
we figure that after everything his pc actually ended up costing $ 350 more than my original player .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
this player is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O
would pay more for it if i had too !####O O O O O O O O O O
not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
the zenxtra is very sturdy and versatile .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use .####O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
i would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
its also fun to use !####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i love the glass touchpad .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
apple no longer includes idvd with the computer and furthermore , apple does n't even offer it anymore !####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
such as pages , numbers , and so on .####O O O O O O O O O O
great deal on an amazing lap top !####B-OP O O O B-OP O O O
spent 2 hours on phone with 256mb flash .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
still pretty pricey , but i 've been putting off money for a while as a little zen fund , and finally got to use it .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in fact , somehow ( and i never opened it up ) some specks of dust or something got inside the screen and are now there permanently , behind the front of the screen , in the way of the display .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O
i have owned at least 4 to 5 phones and computers - but this is by far the most superior machine i have ever owned .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i have had it 9 months and it is already a $ 250 loss .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with awesome graphics and assuring security , it 's perfect !####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O
cons : price is a bit ridiculous , kinda heavy .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
logic board utterly fried , cried , and laid down and died .####B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
and i babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
would highly recommend this camera , though .####O O B-OP O O O O O
i get a ton of compliments on its size , and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus , i can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you 're restricted to the width of your body for computing room .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
his language was so bad i swore i was taking the turing test , and it was failing .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i returned it to best buy on the ninteenth of april .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
dell sucks####O B-OP
the ac power port becomes loose over time####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O
which is what i did , check out my zen 5517 !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
words can not express how much i love my new player .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
but if you can ' t make your product last more than a year , you will not get my business again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a lifelong windows user , i was extremely pleased to make the change to apex .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i sent it back and found this time that the battery was faulty , so i got a new one and some other fixes they found .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , i had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my pc , but took the apple to the conference .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sure hope best buy will replace it asap .####O O O O O O O O O
some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software , but there is no guarantee .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
this player looks great on the surface : 17 " inch screen , good price-point , nice appearance , boots up quickly , runs fast etc .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O
only good thing is the graphics quality .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the zenxtra 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
out of all the laptops i have owned , this is by far the best !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i absolutely love my phone !####O O B-OP O O O
now , the next issue i had freaked me out .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i told them that i just received my brand new ipod but i was having issues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the zenxtra is no exception .####O O O O O O
very powerful especially for the money .####O B-OP O O O O O
i have never really been big on downloading anything so i was n't too worried about getting a song , plus i thought i was protected by norton .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
since i have always used apple products , the choice of the zen was obvious .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've almost have bought every generation of macminis since 2005 , and this one has n't let me down .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is also fast as can be... you get what you pay for... well worth the investment####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
heck , i like all mac computers , but they 're all way too pricey for the kind of economy the u .s . is going through .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally pulled the trigger and i am blown away by how much more i enjoy my computer tasks using the zen mini!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it would n't fit in most 17-inch bags .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
the netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
great mp3 player , easy to use for beginners in the household .####B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
then , within 5 months , the charger crapped out on me .####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O
winters is on it 's way and i imagine it will be cozy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
which i still use and have hooked up to my tv .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
we were pc users .####O O O O O
what a waste .####O O B-OP O
for some odd reasons the computer does n't recognize the operation system .####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
in summary , take your money elsewhere .####O O O O O O O O
i am forever changed and will no longer buy a windows based machine for personal use .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
images are crisp and clean .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
the majority of the reviews seem to be for the 13 .3 zen model # md101ll/a .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
which is great i am running notmad software and scored a 5 .x on the index i have never seen a windows machine have a total score in the 5 's .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i spent months looking for a good mp3 player for me and i finally found it !####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
tech support would not fix the problem unless i bought your plan for $ 150 plus .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i saw walmart had the same computer for about $ 650 but still knowing what i know now , i would not buy it at that price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary product key .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
bottom line , i doubt you 'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i have no idea how to burn cd 's or to use the web cam , just for starters .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
you just lose a customer .####O O O O O O
two of the times was in one month .####O O O O O O O O O
i took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of laptops .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
they are closed at 9 pm eastern .####O O O O O O O O
at least those computers did n't just die on me like this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this thing is a lemon .####O O O O O O
they replaced it and so far so good .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
if you get a lemon ( i have two thirds of my zen ) , you have to send it in for repairs several times before they will replace it , even if they have numerous problems with the same version of their computers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life was shorter than expected .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
i can guarantee this will be the last dvd player i will ever purchase !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen is nice , side view angles are pretty good .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
i am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when i got back in town .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't have stupid pop up windows ( even when i have pop ups blocked ) , i do have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download , and best of all i can run all the web programming software i need to use all at once without slowing me down .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not recommend this company or their products!!!!####O O O B-OP O O O O O
when the buyer returned it wal mart just boxed it , taped it shut resold it as new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we carry the zen around here and there , hence it 's kinda of irritating when the lcd just " slide " downwards .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
this is the first time for me to use this player and i 'm really happy with the move .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
well , they do n't care a bunch .####O O O O O O O O O
but until now , no complains at all .####O O O O O O O O O
it is in the best condition and has a really high quality .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
games being the main issue .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
a tip for people looking into this computer : do not buy it save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i can throw anything at it ( and i do ) , pictures , video editing , schoolwork .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm honestly afraid that it will burn me , it 's that hot !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and i have never had any issues with it freezing .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if that is the case for you , i would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate it .####O B-OP O O
i got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime i touched the lid , ( mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed ) but i suffered thru it and would constantly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
it 's absolutely wonderful and worth the price !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
it works really well .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
all in all great item highly recommend it .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O
out of the box i noticed how small it was and was exactly what i was looking for .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it has spent more time in repair shops than i can possibly recount here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought my first digital camera after seeing the product demonstrated .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
very disappointed becase i have had toshibas for years , and never a issue .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen shows great colors .####O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i am not one to throw things like this around but it is an ipod so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little , while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the computer blinks it shuts off at will .####O O O O O O O O O
actually , i had noticed the one on the sales floor also did n't have sound !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i understand i should call apple tech support about any variables ( which is my purpose of writing this con ) as variables could be a bigger future problem .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got this at an amazing price from amazon and it arrived just in time .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the zenxtra net book operates very well .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i hate it !####O B-OP O O
buying this dvd player would allow me to make the transition .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it works fine , and all the software seems to run pretty well .####O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
a great camera tool !####O B-OP O O O
it was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O
was debating to buy one for months , checked out different stuff on youtube , and read different articles and debates , i just didnt really wan na spend the money but im glad that i did .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
being an apex user my whole life....####O O O O O O O
bought from wal-mart , i believe that this player was a repaired item .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am very happy i bought this mac , well worth the extra money .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
buyers beware .####O O O
i 'm going to try and keep my old g4 on the road for as long as possible .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm so glad i purchased a mac and not another pc!!!####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
loaded with bloatware .####O O B-ASP O
my g3 was worth ( after 3 years of use ! ) $ 375 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bought this gateway m-50 or 150 early 2007 .####O O O O O O O O O
so , buyers beware !####O O O O O
- called headquarters again , they report that tft panel is broken , should be fixed by the end of the week ( week 3 ) .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the performance is definitely superior to any computer i 've ever put my hands on .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
my husband purchased a player at the same time for about $ 300 less ( he got a pc ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this computer does n't do that well with certain games it can ' t play some and it becomes too hot while playing games .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
another issue i have with it is the battery .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O
i 'm overall pleased with the interface and the portability of this product .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
stop living in the stone age and buy this player , you will not be sorry at all!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
because it is a defective product .####O O O O B-OP O O
i had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity , because it is very sensitive .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
no machine has come remotely close to causing as many problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has all the expected features and more + plus a wide screen and more than roomy flash .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
deal of the year .####O O O O O
the only problem is a lack of screen resolutions !####O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the display is incredibly bright , much brighter than my powerbook and very crisp .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
it 's just what we were looking for and it works great .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
love it .####B-OP O O
they respond : " your dissatisfaction is noted "...####O O O O O O O O O
the one thing that apple does right is computers .####O O O O O O O O O O
she brought out 2 other identical netbooks and still insist that " it is like that one " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i only used it to browse the internet and and i dont know how many times it has spontaneously shut down and it is just a blank screen now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
this was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it freezes , and it always shows that there is an error , so i have to restart it a few times every time i use it .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and i would recommend this to anyone looking for an ipod .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
definitely worth spending the money on it .####O B-OP O O O O O O
usb3 peripherals are noticably less expensive than the thunderbolt ones .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O O
has a 5-6 hour battery life .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i had in the past a zenxtra they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
the system it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the people there just changed for me on the spot and i got a new arm piece and they did n't even request for a receipt .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
small screen somewhat limiting but great for travel .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O
i paid for a digital camera , but was sent a used one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if the number of patrons in the zen store are any indication , ipod and other pc manufacturers need to take note .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
returned player for a 4th repair and it came back but now would lock up and randomly reboot frequently making the laptop unusable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the price is great for this model , i only plan on using it for media in the entertainment room .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there is nothing better .####O O O B-OP O
i needed a new computer for graduate school ( had never owned a player before ) , and the only reason i did n't purchase this player was because my school 's website strongly recommended students purchase pcs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i try to use it today and can ' t read the logon .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zen one computer that i bought is 17 inch screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it , but i like the big screen on it .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O
charger seems large for this class of computer .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
after looking at all the pros and cons , i decided on the zenxtra .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
might not make the avid gamer happy but i do n't really think that is what this player is designed for .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great pick for portability and affordability .####B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the 13 " macbook is portable , durable , and very capable .####O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O

i have had to send in my phone three times to get it fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great product .####B-OP O O
this player has left me with a horrible taste in my mouth for mp3 brand products .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
very fast for my needs .####O B-OP O O O O
overall a nice computer .####O O B-OP O O
laptop is advertised as a 15 " but the casing looks like that of a 17 " .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
great wifi too .####B-OP B-ASP O O
it makes sorting out all those photos on my camera is a breeze , and organizing them by place , time taken , or uploading them to an online print shop , or upload them to flickr or facebook etc , is not hard at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
it 's light and easy to transport .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
seriously considering a larger laptop to replace the ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O
so then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back , but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened , and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair ( the price of the ipod ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O

ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about my camera .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i returned the computer to hp and they kept it for 3 months .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the g3 shipped to their repair depot on june 24 and returned on july 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this camera is also awesome for my sons virtual home schooling .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i should have realized that trouble was brewing .####O O O O O O O O O
all i will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hunk of crap vaio .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
i have had a total of 5 different phones from many different manufactures .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they gave me a hard time yet again , but their was a malfunction in the battery itself , it did n't die .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
if you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get a player !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is known as safari , and if you are doing any website work , you should know that many hosting companies do not support it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
these new problems were the final straws ;####O O O O O O O O
it is so great , i can hardly ever take my hands off it !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this player in order to replace my old dell player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
despite the inconvenient weight , i opted for the 12 cell battery .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
when this happened i would have to completely power off my computer and restart it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
about 2 months ago i bought the 2011 zenxtra , which was an upgrade from my 2010 zen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this system came loaded with mediasource .####O O O O O B-ASP O
acer has set me up with free recovery discs , when they are available since i asked .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it has had some problems .####O O O O B-OP O
again this is just my personal honest opinion .####O O O O O O O O O
i have had this phone for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i had to buy a bottom flash to go with it , as i am old school and hate the controls , but knew that before i bought it , now it works great , need to get adjusted to the key board , as i am used to a bigger one and pounding .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O

i just took the broken cords into the nomad store and they gave me new ones .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i dislike is the touchpad , alot of the times its unresponsive and does things i dont want it too , i would recommend using a remote with it .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O
with a healthy pessimism , i took the machine home and tried to find a flaw .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am so happy to have purchased this computer .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
it easily fits into most computer bags but does n't weigh down a backpack or satchel when being carried with spirals and/or textbooks .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the guy then said that if i insist on having the hinge tightened , they can do it for me but i have to accept the condition after the " repair " .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , i went back .####O O O O O O
i just love this camera , i just wish it were all silver or they had all black .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
high price tag , however .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
i have had no luck with staples or phones to resolve this problem .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
the price and features more than met my needs .####O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O
bought notebook 07/2009 .####O O O O

this player looked brand new and was shipped very quickly .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty would transfer to the new computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
my laptop with eax crashed and i did not want flash card .####O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
finally set the player back to apex after a month of hell .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i believe this is because i was more active than the average user , meaning i average about three " tabs " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i or my dad paid over twenty four hundred dollars for everything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also consider the ms office apps are all trial versions , hope you have your own copies .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O

not with apple .####O O O O
not sure on eax .####O O O B-ASP O

it is fast and i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other problems .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O

also , the battery does not last very long at all .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O
my problem was with t-mobile service .####O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
but in resume this computer rocks !####O O O O O B-OP O
it has served my needs quite nicely for the most part .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
just be careful ; you always have to give up some good stuff for others .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
can never go wrong with apple products .####O O O O O O O O
i thought the white mac computers looked dirty too quickly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
seems a much more economical way to get into apple than their other computers .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
you wo n't have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient auto program that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a nice little gadget .####O O O B-OP O O O
at first when i got this product , i loved it .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
they are by far the easiest systems to actually learn about computers with .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
returned it to walmart .####O O O O O

i have had this dvd player for almost 6 months and can honestly say that i will never buy another computer if it is not a player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming in front for headphones / mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction .####B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth , they come loose .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
there is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this was a great deal for a decked out dvd player .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
my last player gave me a constant battle even though it was also completely new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
getting the i/p button is a must .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O

the 13 " zen just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to ca this is the best price we can get for a great product .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
well , maybe more like week one .####O O O O O O O O
i sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall though , for the money spent it 's a great deal .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i just got this dvd player , and so far i am very happy with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2 .5 hrs out of it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is the volume control .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
battery life could be better but overall for the price and toshiba 's reputation for phones it 's great !####B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
needless to say , not too happy with the product .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O

the old unibody zen could fry an egg after a while .####O O O O O O O O O O O O

overall i am very satisfied with the purchase .####O O O O B-OP O O O O
i do admit it is pricey but the saying is really true with this dvd player ( you get what you pay for ) .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apple has a reputation and is well known for its easy usage .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O

first of all , i 've been an apex fan for more than fifteen years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm the pro-active type so i went off and did some preventative fixes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when the computer has been on for several minutes , it will occasionaly just go off by itself .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after replacing the spinning hard disk with an ssd drive , my player is just flying .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
we 'll save our money to replace it with this player again !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i edit and burn to dvd a lot of video , so i obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i was getting extrememly frustrated when i would want to do these simple taks that i would have to wait and wait and read for things to download or play that would clog up my pc .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was very excited because this was my first personal computer and i was purchasing it with my own money i had recieved from graduation presents .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm pretty sure when i bought it , my bank account went ' ouch !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all-in-all , i would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
:) great product , great price , great delivery , and great service .####O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
enough said .####O O O
what a great little camera .####O O B-OP O O O
i would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
when i finally held it in my hands i kissed it , yes i did .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got the new adapter and there was no change .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
finally , i should note that i took the hard drive flash from my old eeepc and installed it before i even powered on for the first time .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a huge monstrosity of this camera !####O O O O O O O O O
the cool thing about the ipod book was that i went on my honeymoon and shot a bunch of pictures and movies with myiphone , then i came back and put them onto the ipods and made a pretty good dvd movie with all the pictures and videos from my trip .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am very happy with this camera .####O O O B-OP O O O O
a lot of features and shortcuts on the mbp that i was never exposed to on a normal pc .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has far exceeded my expectations for power , storage , and ability .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
but i did n't want to spend another thousand on a player since my work already provides me with an ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a laugh too !####O O O O O O
i had the computer for a full year and it was a new computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
soft touch , anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
this is quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands .####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it 's fast and has excellent battery life .####O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it is meant to be portable .####O O O O O O O
there has been no problem with anything .####O O O O O O O O
i 'm really frustrated by this experience .####O O O B-OP O O O O
i previously owned a toshiba and it only lasted about 2 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my second mac book pro .####O O O O O O O O
solution : it turned out to be pretty simple .####O O O O O O O O O O
its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i contacted apex about this situation and was given excuses , without results .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i can say is that the camera setting does n't work like it should all the time .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
the biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
i fell in love with the apex pavillion and that was my replacement and now i could not imagine going back to an acer at all .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh , boy !####O O O O
they were great in handling this problem , and i 'm looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by air sounds more like by truck to me .####O O O O O O O O O O
people know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was starting to boil .####O O O O O O
i just love this camera !####O O B-OP O O O
it is better than my old acer player .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
i have full control at all times of what is going on - there is no control + alt + delete business anymore .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we have n't had any problems with it at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i love its solid build , light weight and excellent battery life ( for now ) .####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they update the next version on the zen book the quality of it will be better .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
can ' t wait until i go on vacation and take it with me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
pc users use the powerpoint program for slide-show presentation and creative users utilize keynote .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it 's a good fix , in my opinion .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i already have a zen bought last year that 's standard size .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
at first , the computer seemed a great deal -- seemingly high-end specs for a low , low price .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
i blame the scroll wheel .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O
i had always used pcs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
but i 'm still learning so ca n't rate it yet for everything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
so ? how can you solve it ? c'mon , i just bought this dvd player 2 weeks ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they also have a longer service life than other computers ( i have several friends who still use the older apple powerbooks ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it could n't have been a better decision .####O O O O O O O O O
im glad that it has such great features in it .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
buy this if you like being tortured , teased , frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old player .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very annoying .####O B-OP O
battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i will never purchase a player again ever .####O O O O O O O O O
it is really thick around the battery .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
so in late march , early april 2009 i was without it again for a couple weeks while i had online courses i had to complete and my fiance was in afghanistan and web conferencing was the best communication method we had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
asus has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks , and i would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
summary : after doing some investigation on the web , i have found that toshiba nb205s are not chronically not booting .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no waiting to have my claim reviewed by someone in another state ( or more often , another country ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i first purchased this zen model " 1764 " on april 6 , 201####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also liked the glass screen .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the new os is great on this dvd player !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
when i called sony the customer service was great .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
graphics are clean and sharp , internet interfaces are seamless .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
( if you ever see the spinning beachball come up when you think it should n't , check the " activity monitor " app to see if the disk throughput has temporarily dropped to zero .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the unibody construction is solid , sleek and beautiful .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O
all the programs are easy and straight forward on the zenxtra , it is clean and organized , which i always strive to be myself .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
but to be honest , the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think i ll buy this player next time .####O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
battery is lasting about 6 hours as i am surfing the web on sundays while checking football scores and watching funny youtube videos .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mediasource software is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
now i have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the player !####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
i burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table , so i can place it there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all for such a great price .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i babyed the heck out of it and i still do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
that was my first apple product and since then i have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs i have bought .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
nice packing .####B-OP B-ASP O
setting would change for some reason , the screen size would change on it 's own , like the pixel sizes and whatnot .####B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
then on top of it all their customer service center is in the middle east .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
thanks for the fast shipment and great price .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the image is great , and the sound is excellent .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
summary : dont buy apex .####O O O O O O
if you have the money i suggest going for the i7 .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i dislike the weight and size , cubersome .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O
also is portable and reliable .####O O B-OP O B-OP O
before i begin , i will say that i am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this player - i am an ipod fanboy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
only a few days after i received the computer back , the screen froze again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O
and the best part is that it even comes with a free printer ( when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course ) !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
microsoft word was not on it and i had to buy it seperately .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was at my door in less than 24 hours .####O O O O O O O O O O O
my laptop now has no battery .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
is this partially due to the fact that it is running i/p button ?####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
my sister has the same player as me and she is in a band and uses garageband to record and edit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
quality display i love hp , , it 's the only computer/printer we will buy .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
and not to mention after using it for a few months or so , the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you ca n't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
love this player wonderful price for what you get !####B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
if you want more information on this phone i suggest going to apple .com and heading towards the zen page for more information of the applications .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it is the worst camera ever####O O O B-OP O O
i will never again buy another mp3 player , not will i buy gateway , or emachine as they are all from the same company .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate , i chose the zen over the white zen .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
so of course this one came through with the awesomeness !####O O O O O O O O O O O
it really is very light compared to other computers .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
unfortunately , apple 's quality has continued to slide .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i would recommend this phone phone to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i believe that the quality of this camera is worth the price .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
great product , very easy to use and great graphics .####B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i am sorry that i purchased this player .####O O O O O O O O O

you will love this dvd player if you choose to buy it .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i tell everyone i see out looking to get this or another toshiba .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but this dvd player is the best !####O O O O O O B-OP O
they did n't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , hdd secures inside using rails , and there is only one set on the main hard drive .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i would never go back any more , i love this player so much and i would recommend it to everyone .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i was a little worry at first because i do n't have a lot of experience with os .x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
- they lost my player for a month####O O O O O O O O
( beware , their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a player is .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this lap top and the charge time dose n't last as long as they say it will more like 2 hours####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
so , the hard disk capacity really does n't matter to me .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
i bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is easily portable and i take it everywhere i go and might require internet access .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
more times that not the screen pops up saying i have a bad internet connection , or the page can n't be displayed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O

i love the easy to see screen , and it works well for work , personal or just play .####O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O
so i 'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all the above aside this machine rocks !####O O O O O O B-OP O
it 's fast , light , and simple to use .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
great os , fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the skip button and adding the thunderbolt port .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
you may just lose 1 customer for now .####O O O O O O O O O
- complied to their protocol , called number , made " case " , got an email address to send complaint .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
it 's just a great toy to have around .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
as a computer science student in college , i find that the portability , longevity , and ease of use of this player make me ( shockingly ) want to do homework more ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased an apex right after my high school graduation .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's even easy to hook up to other wireless networks .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
so this was great for me .####O O O B-OP O O O
love that it does n't take up space like a regular computer .####B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
here we are another year later and the g3 doing the same thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i am very happy !####O O O B-OP O
do i like the computer ? well , other than not getting viruses , i guess it is ok .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
i bought this player the moment unibody product came to the market .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while we struggle with all the crashes and phones , the kids computers stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for business !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
after using it for over a month , an issue started to surface .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm returning mine####O O O O
i love this product because it is the 6610 and its 15 .6 " .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

built-in apps are purely amazing .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
this player was very easy to set up .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
even though the computer is larger they did not make the player larger .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
this is a great value for the money .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
the cool thing about this is anyone can use it .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i 'm going to buy a logitech c270 .####O O O O O O O O O
if yo like practicality this is the player for you .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
anyway , i can ' t even install one of the 3 printers i have in my house so i am unable to print .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site , then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the minute you fire it up it 's all good , very easy user interface .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i had to return it because it would n't even start .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
but , for the cost this is a winner .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
minis make sense for a lot of people .####O O O O O O O O O
it is robust , with a friendly use as all apple products .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
another two weeks later and it was back in my possession .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
would buy 100 more of these if i could .####O O O O O O O O O O
i love it so much .####O B-OP O O O O
the screen resolution was exactly what i was looking for .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
i would recommend to any one looking for a first class computer !####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
it 's solid .####O O B-OP O
i look forward to years of use , it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i bought this player because of the performance to price ratio .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
i reinstalled windows through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
i contacted acer and they are giving me free recovery dvds , so do n't go and pay for them , just ask for them and they should give them to you .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen almost looked like a barcode when it froze .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
the computer could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never go back to this player again !####O O O O O O O O O O
this little dvd player is helping me get work done !####O O O O O O O O O O O
i got this phone on black friday .####O O O O O O O O
asked the customer service rep .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i did think it had a player because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i purchased .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i paid about the same for my zenxtra as i did for the compaq a few years back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that i have , is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can see why the have soooo much money .####O O O O O O O O O O
seems to me that 's the best way to get apple 's attention .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can ' t imagine my life without it anymore !####O O O O O O O O O O O
i do everything on this computer - check email , facebook , shop , check blogs , write papers , listen to music , and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i play a lot of casual games online , and the touchpad is very responsive .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
what a mistake !####O O O O
moving from a pc to mac has never been easier , and i 'm glad that i did it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i saved for this phone for 3 months and i can tell you personally it was worth the wait .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
never any doubt i would get a zen , just was n't sure which one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
he can ' t stand it .####O O O O O O O
1 ) payed $ 2200 for a " premium " player####O O O O O O O O O O O
the next time i had an issue my lightscribe would n't work .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about this camera .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
very light and easily maneuverable .####O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O
the internet speed is spectacular .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
now when i order i did not go full scale for the webcam or full zoom i wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when i use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the third apex dvd player in our family .####O O O O O O O O O O O
one of the primary reasons why i purchased an ipad was to store photographs so that i could show to my customers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am a freelance graphic artist .####O O O O O O O
it was getting old and i needed a new school computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
with the upgraded memory , the zen pro never has an issue running many many applications at once !####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
the only pro to read this player it was under $ 600 !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
let me tell you , this machine is great .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i opted for the squaretrade 3-year computer accidental protection warranty ( $ 1500-2000 ) which also support " accidents " like drops and spills that are not covered by applecare .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this is what i call a good after sales service .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i love it - never had a computer i was so impressed with - and i 've had a lot of laptops and desktops - this one is far and above the best one i ever had before .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O
his was worth $ 36 .####O O O O O O
and this dvd player is a quality supplier .####O O O O O O O O O
it is more than enough computer to keep up with the needs of a high school student .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
from the build quality to the performance , everything about it has been sub-par from what i would have expected from this player####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
graphics are much improved .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
i picked it out because it was inexpensive ( $ 400 ) and i thought it would be a good , easy to use first player .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
and then , a guy came out to serve me instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
they sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
still , this camera is perfect for all day use at school and work .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
its not bad just very very annoying .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
i had my pc for 3 years and going to a macbook player player like i leaped through time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but while this is one big advantage ( as you may know from the company s recent commercials ) there are other things to consider before going with apple .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to pay $ 100 for a universal charger for this cheap $ 300 player .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
but enough about that , i am able to convert for life .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , the g3 purchased was also a g3 and again , i have to say i hated it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it is a great computer for that and i have to say i 'm happy i switched .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
very very highly recommended .####O O O B-OP O
oh , it is such a great piece of equipment .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
runs good and does the job , ca n't complain about that !####B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
this process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
( you may be reading one now !####O O O O O O O O
finally , the biggest problem has been tech support .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
they went through asking me open up various components , taking battery out , hard disk apart , and after 2 hours on player could not fix it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no cd rom in the new version there 's no way i 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
trashed it when i spilled a latte on it while writing at a cafe .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've installed to it additional ssd and digital id3 tags .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never buy another apex computer .####O O O O O O O O
the manufacturer 's warranty only covers replacement/repair of parts .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
having had experience with a zenxtra , i was disappointed to find that the toshiba nb305 laptop has major problems .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
some features are n't friendly ( volume wheel , sound quality , etc .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
anyway , wo n't replace this player .####O O O O O O O O
i recommend this dvd player if you want the best player on the market .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
although i opted for the lowest end macbook zen this thing holds its own .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any ipod : screen size is not something i 'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
but , at the same time they ( the company ) would not and could not do anything about my problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i waited and waited and no phone .####O O O O O O O O
by week two , my phone had overheated and was completely dead even though i did not use it too much .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
they have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and i 'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
satisfy what i paid for it .####B-OP O O O O O O
love it so far .####B-OP O O O O
it had a seventeen inch screen which i wanted , but i did n't realize at the time it would be such a monster !####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also got the added bonus of a 30 " hd monitor , which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh !####O O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
purchased as a gift for a friend .####O O O O O O O O
the internet capabilities are also very strong and picks up signals very easily .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
? i am only interested in the 15 .4 mcbook pro model # md103ll/a####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was going to buy today and noticed it went back up to $ 344 .99 ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mbp is beautiful has many wonderful capabilities .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
after trying to get some help he disconnected on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in ( mousing over the battery icon would read , for example , " 74 % , plugged in , not charging " ) , requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
a tip for people looking into this player : do not buy it save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you pay for what you get for .####O O O O O O O O
this player is much more efficient than an ipod so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did n't because it was already over 2 ,400 dollars !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
after fumbling around with the os i started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm definitely not hard on apex and guarantee 100 % that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets , and rather quickly too .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
however , i love this particular mac because its very fast , great size , and has fantastic features like the built-in radio and easy receiving button .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it runs perfectly .####O B-ASP B-OP O
shipped very quickly and safely .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
i bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her , it 's very lightweight , and the response for the computing she 's doing ( internet focused activity : mail , research , etc . ) is excellent ;####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
and at one point , they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when i upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the ipod ( i bought the memory stick they recomended ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
best money i ever spent .####B-OP O O O O O
i was said it 's video card .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i loaded eax via bootcamp and it works flawlessly !####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
10/10 five stars would recommend .####O B-OP I-OP O B-OP O
this is my second digital camera .####O O O O O O O
i have a lapdesk which i can use , but i can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in my opinion it was not as user friendly as i expected either .####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
i now own another hewlett packard .####O O O O O O O
with what i paid for this computer it should have had everything on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it looks and feels solid , with a flawless finish .####O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i 'll stick to this dvd player .####O O O O O O O O
he gave me this pc about 3 years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is starting off good .####O O O O B-OP O
this was my first macbook purchase ever .####O O O O O O O O
i 've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it works perfectly .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
this dvd player is a great brand , even though i have n't had it for a long time , i am very happy with it !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
finally , i purchased a toshiba .####O O O O O O O
awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in camera .####B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
if you ask me , for this price it should be included .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i can ' t imagine ever buying this player again !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the first time it crashed was maybe going on a year and a half of having it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when you call tech support you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its perfect , not much heavy .####O B-OP O O O B-OP O
you can ' t even get a satellite card which is why i bought to begin with .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
after doing cad work all day at work , using a higher end pc , i could n't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has good speed and plenty of hard drive space .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i bought it from hsn because it was " bundled " with extra software , but as it turns out , that software just crashes it more often.....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
upgrading from on/off button , thru mediasource software , to mediascreen was a snap ;####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than apple 's previous player .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i have n't used it for anything high tech yet , but i love it already .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
another satisfied customer .####O B-OP O O
this hardware seems to be better than the imac in that it is n't $ 1400 and smaller .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it doesnt get hot like my pc , with technology always at the tip of our fingertips anytime i forget how to do something i just google it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery gets so hot it is scary .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O
it lasted for many years of travel , kids and abuse and if i fired it up today , it would work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do not buy it !####O O O O O
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
not too expense and has enough storage for most users and many ports .####O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
everything is so easy to use , creative software is just so much simpler than microsoft software .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
it 's fast , quiet , incredibly small and affordable compared to other mac models .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
the pictures are clear as can be .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
i got this one for thanks giving offer for $ 962 :) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that 's the downside for me .####O O O O O O O
well , i bought this player a month or two ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this player was bad from the first day of use ---- brought it back to store for return of money .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i 've owned every " apex " model apple laptop for the last 8 years , this is by far the worst one i 'd ever had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
with this dvd player it comes with free security software to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
guess i 'll stay away from hp .####O O O O O O O O
the item received was exactly as identified .####O O O O O O O O
my toshiba did not have sound on everything , just certain things .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
now they are believers in the product .####O O O O O O O O
the ease of set up was terrific .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
yet , canon wo n't do anything about the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O
if it 's not shipped on the next business day , called on a friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
thank you for your great product !####O O O O B-OP O O
its still going .####O O O O
back she goes !####O O O O
i took it back to best buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the worst a player ever did to me was freeze up .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
runs very smoothly .####B-ASP O B-OP O
power supply went bad after 2 weeks --####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
great price free shipping what else can i ask for!!####B-OP B-ASP B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
in short , you could say your mac could become your best friend ( no intention of replacing rover your dog ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
using this machine is like a mild form of torture .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i am really heartbroken to have to post a terrible review .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the battery life has not decreased since i bought it , so i 'm thrilled with that .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i shopped around before buying .####O O O O O O
i do n't understand why only media player player is included .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O
the latest and mightiest zenxtra 17-inch was bought by my university on the 30th of june 2009 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is basically the best camera camera camera have ever had or used .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
it is very durable , i am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O
it had some kind of pre installed software update that completely shut the computer down when you clicked it .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i plan on using this dvd player for a long time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't have any technical pearls to share .####O O O O O O O O O O
but with this laptop , the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
its a good player for its value .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
but the arm velcro is torn after one use .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
yeah , it 's super expensive .####O O O O O B-OP O
it was always getting froze up .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O
love it i 've always been an ipod fan boy , but never had the money to buy a zen only ipads andiphones , and this is my first ipod blew me away completely .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
system is running great .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ok , this is probably the best digital series ever devised by this camera .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
so a couple of years later , i was a dumb phone girl and had to have the wireless internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they have more problems then a 1980 's computer .####O O O O O O O O O O
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
there is no way i will buy a lg product in the future .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the memory was gone and it was not able to be used .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
very satisfied .####O B-OP O
i know that asus is known for making motherboards , but this is the worst computer experience that i have ever had .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
web surfuring is smooth and seamless .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
an absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
this player is great !####O O O B-OP O
i bought this dvd player from best buy under a year ago to replace my old dvd players .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just a month and a half or two months ago , my vaio crashed again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
enough said .####O O O
have n't regretted it one bit .####O O O O O O O
sounds like a typewriter , but if you can get past that , this is a great laptop for a little money !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
after replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working ( 3 months of use ) which was frustrating .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this is my first apple phone .####O O O O O O O
we now own two of these , identical .####O O O O O O O O O
i saved about $ 100 plus tax ordering on amazon and since i have prime , it arrived overnight for just $ 3 .99 more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
best buy laughed when i told them they should replace it instead of expecting me to be without a computer again for another couple of weeks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O
i previously owned an older zen that died after about 5 or 6 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far , a great product .####O O O O B-OP O O
apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , this dvd player is priced just right .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i 've always owned this player and decided to try a macbook to see what it 's all about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this worked just fine .####O O O B-OP O
went silently .####O O O
this is now my 3rd dvd player and i really honestly love it !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the player in the sky!!####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is excellent , the display is excellent , and downloading apps is a breeze .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all i use the old portable flash which works good .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
fits all my personal needs .####B-OP O O O O O
wonderful zooming .####B-OP B-ASP O
so it was only about 2 weeks ago .####O O O O O O O O O
premium price for the os more than anything else .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
the only solution is to turn the brightness down , etc .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i feel that enough people have this phone these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far , it 's an average laptop - no better , no worse than the ipod i replaced .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
the second issue i had with it occured a month later and it kept overheating , even if on for less than an hour !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ultimate graduation gift .####O O O O O
i called back to ensure that received it , they had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
c'mon , lg .####O O O O
being a tech savvy , apple - product loving person , i 'm glad i finally got this dvd player !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
you will regret it if you buy any mp3 player .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
if you buy , pray you dont have major problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is the battery only last 1 .5-2 .0 hrs when not plugged in .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
they really do have the worlds very worst repair service .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it doesnt overheat or make any loud noises .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
i wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused , because they knew it was trouble .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
after replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working ( 3 months of use ) which was frustrating .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
anyway , i used daily nice compact design .####O O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O
i wish the zen would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the os at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the zen is a perfect supplementary computer to another phone or desktop ( my wife and i have another phone ) , or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can call apex and they want you to buy more software to fix it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i finally did it and this machine is the way to go !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , owing to these problems , i went out and got myself the zen macbook , which i am using with great satisfaction at this very moment .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
it gives me the power and speed that i need to run all the programs i use to edit .####O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i would highly recommend this dvd player .####O O O B-OP O O O O
at home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24 " lcd screen , so built in screen size is not terribly important .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i wish the volume could be louder and the player didnt break after only a month .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
my friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance , picture quality , and ease of use .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
a scratch on a $ 1 ,500 dvd player unforgivable .####O O O O O O O O O O O
what 's also interesting is this survey changed my ratings the first time i submitted it in case it does n't keep what i put here are my ratings####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
much of which player ended up paying for .####O O O O O O O O O
a zen very easy to use and it simply makes sense .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
a little pricey but it is well , well worth it .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O
he has replaced his hard drive twice and ( of course ) has had to pay for antivirus software every year .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
i brought this player last friday , and originally it worked fantastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i 'm so happy with this dvd player !####O O O B-OP O O O O O
the book is useless .####O O O B-OP O
it is made better , thicker , and all out tough !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
( for those old enough to remember , it is similar to beta versus vhs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall very impressed , thank you apple and amazon !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i took it back for a full refund .####O O O O O O O O O
i have had some excellent computer and have found i had no idea what to do with them####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could n't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
this a starter notebook .####O O O O O
in november my computer messed up entirely and would n't power on after installing a windows update , i had to have my hd flashed and lost everything on it , including my school assignments and irreplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason i was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installing it deleted my history .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not know for sure .####O O O O O O O
it also came with a built it web cam which is great because i can see an communicate with my family members back home .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
purchased a zen lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O
this notebook restarts every time there is a new update , so if you do n't save your files and information , everything will be lost .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
it is everything i 'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
its only crashed on me one time in the 3 months i 've had it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
taking notes , research , an online class and such and did n't want to spend too much on my first machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
will certainly use macconnection again .####O O O O O O
a couple things you should know :####O O O O O O O
so do n't get it .####O O O O O O
its seen in movies , sitcoms , prominent important people carry and use them and they are great !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i like coming back to playlists but this player is lacking in speaker quality compared to my $ 400 old player .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
it has a faster flash and more playback .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i am a wife , mom and a school teacher and a college student .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zenxtra is the premier choice for creative students .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
pay attention to the specs if you want these options .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
note , however , that any existing magsafe accessories you have will not work with the magsafe 2 connection .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
other installed features , such as certain printer software , are also most attractive .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O
they are about the same size keys .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
if this is an improvement in customer service then i would hate too see what it was before !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had nothing but problems since the day i took it out of the box !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
never had a single problem , and do n't have to worry about apex .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would like to tell you about the best phone phone phone you just got from apex .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
so buyer beware when buying toshiba####O O O O O O
this causes my wrist to scrape up against it .####O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm so disgusted that i wasted my money on this product .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O
creative said i had done the damage .####O O O O O O O O
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the 15 " zenxtra####O B-OP O O O O
i saw the bad reviews from people saying to buy directly from apple and i was concerned but i took my chances and am overly impressed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i have used a couple of others on the job as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i upgraded it 's reception to 2gb , i am very happy with it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it seems to have some options that are installed but do not work like i thought they would .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this dvd player is so much better looking and so thin !####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O
apparently well built and gorgeous to look at , the i5 zenxtra is a winning combination of price and performance .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
waited on getting this computer , but it has been a great change .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
apex refused to give me the zen and wal mart refused to take it back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is really expensive though .####O O O B-OP O O
we purchased this as a back up computer after our more expensive hp needed to be repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am going to shoot next year and i needed a cheaper , quality computer for the goals i am trying to pursue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 ) player still did not work , blue screen within a week...####O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
very happy with my 7th toshiba player !####O B-OP O O O O O O
i was a little weary at purchasing another zenxtra almost 2 years later but canon looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O
next , most acer laptop fans are on the bottom which is right on your player .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
remote was also very nice and had a solid feel .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
i was given a demonstration of playlists .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
i will stack it up against laptops that cost twice as much any day .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
great battery life .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it blue screened on me without any warning , running simply basic chrome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the graphics are great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
1st hand experience is very important , especially for a new customer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the device speaks about it self .####O O O O O O O
i have found a lot of online sources to help me but think that i would have learned a lot quicker if i would had taken the class .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
screen is a bit glossy , but that 's not too bad .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
be safe buy a sony .####O O O O O O
easy learning curve .####O O O O
as usual at customer service center , she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague ( i could see them ) .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
another thing i might add is the battery life is excellent .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i should have sent it back to them then .####O O O O O O O O O O
so when i had the money to buy one i bought other things instead... a 700 player and some extra stuff with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have other computers that get strong signals that do n't drop in places that this " net " book loses its signal .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
just for a stupid cd .####O O O B-OP O O
i 'm all for saving money but this camera needs to step it up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had upgraded my old zen to lion , so i kind of knew what i was getting , but had n't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
with all the programs that came with it , such as ilife and iwork , i was set from the very beginning .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
before we got this phone , had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the two of us use it regularly .####O O O O O O O O
the screen gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it 's very noticeable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
i like it !####O B-OP O O
the menu consideration is a bit squirrely at times - sometimes too sensitive , and sometimes a bit unresponsive , but it 's usable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
the salesman talked us into this player away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP O O O
never had a problem with it !####O O O O O O O
i love my new computer !####O B-OP O O O O
macs are designed for the " frontal lobe challenged " people out there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
incredible graphics and brilliant colors .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
for example , when my husband turns the light out while i 'm on the computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the os is great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
it is quiet and a real joy to watch work .####O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
the zenxtra was the first apex product that i had ever purchased .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had my computer custom built from sonystyle .com .####O O O O O O O O O O
it 's been time for the zen , and the only debate was which size of the z-mobile , and whether to spring for the retina display .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
its a dog plain and simple .####O O O O O O O
there is no hdmi receptacle , nor is there an sd card slot located anywhere on the device .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
no phone is perfect , but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i called toshiba where i gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it does n't heat up like my old player .####O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased a zenxtra and this to replace a couple of hp units that i was using .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this player does everything i need it to do for school and more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the large screen gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or tv shows on your computer instead of buying an additional tv for your dorm room .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bluetooth was not there at all , and the fingerprint reader driver would be there , but the software would hang after installation was 1/2 way done .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
besides being elegant , the macbooks are durable .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
having a mac certainly makes life easier .####O O O O O O B-OP O
if this would be your first digital purchase then i would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between phones and pc 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's applications are terrific , including the replacements for microsoft office .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
but , i would recommend this product .####O O O O B-OP O O O
i considered i may have too much on the computer , but after looking , there was plenty of space and that is not the issue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
boot-up slowed significantly after all windows updates were installed .####B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
it absolutely is more expensive than most pc players , but the ease of use , security , and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O
so , i 'm cooled on apex buys .####O O O O O O O O O
i purchased this player 9 months ago !####O O O O O O O O
not working = bad####O O O B-OP
also i typed faster then then thenthen letters would show and it got to be realy annoying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
my hp is very heavy .####O O O O B-OP O
it doesnt work worth a damn .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O
called apex many times , they want me to pay the shipping to ship it to their repair center - i was very disappointed since it is a brand new computer !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
frustrated i hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still i think this phone is much ahead from the rest of the pack .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
my first problem was with the pre-loaded norton firewall/security program .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the computer itself was fast , ran smoothly , and had no problems .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
everything was up and running within 15 minutes of unboxing .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's great to have a solid player in the living room .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
all i can say is i am impressed .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
i would n't play a first-person shooter with this , mind , but if you wanted to run ms office , email , chat , download a video , listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store , and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in , i 'd highly recommend checking this out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
it is a great size and amazing optical zoom included !####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
like the price and operation .####B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
when i finally had everything running with all my software installed i plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
they basically told me that the machine would be problem free now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unless you do n't care how long it takes to get going , find something else .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a waste of money from day one !####O O O O O O O O O O
easy to install also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for adsl cable or wifi .####B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
:] it arrived so fast and customer service was great .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
probably wo n't work either .####O O O O O O

i purchased a toshiba satellite m60 ( with harman/kardon speakers ! ) in december of 2005 .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
however , i can refute that osx is " fast " .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
so , you can imagine how unhappy i am with this item .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
it is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good player , but i am very satisfied .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
it is , however , very heavy .####O O O O O O B-OP O

with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

it was okay for over a week before the blue screens started occuring again .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
they only stay charged a little over an hour .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it 's fun to take to a bookstore , sit in the coffee shop area , sign in to wifi and look up book reviews of books i might buy .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a real touchpad , not the toy i saw in other brands .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
good computer and fast .####B-OP O O B-OP O
i would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a player it does not meet the expectations .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
great , quick player for the money .####B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
they have not sent a new one nor called .####O O O O O O O O O O
i highly recommend this phone for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the only thing i miss is that my old alienware phone had backlit keys .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
really no problems with the hand me down computers i received from my children .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sd card reader is slightly recessed and upside down ( the nail slot on the card can not be accessed ) , if this was a self ejecting slot this would not be an issue , but its not .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O

i work in film editing and post production , so i need a camera that not only has power , but memory and speed as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
big mistake !####O O O
after about another month i had to send it in again to acer for repairs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
having usb3 is why i bought this player .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i can ' t even remember how i finally got it taken care of , but i was done with sony after that !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has worked fine .####O O O B-OP O
it was quite easy .####O O O B-OP O
i recommend for word processing and internet users .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O
i have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the only thing that can be updated is the video , other than that you 're all set .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it has been to early to see if this actually fixes the problem or not though .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after a little more than a year of owning the zenxtra , the monitor has completely died .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i have recently converted back to a player and i could n't be happier !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
i finally made the leap after my gateway crapped out on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything about this camera is not only visually appealing , but very easy to use .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
it 's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
overall i feel this dvd player was poor quality , had poor performance , although it did have great battery life when it did work .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
from the start , when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even if you do n't do business , thats okay , it 's incredibly fast .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
either way the entire thing was just a joke , a complete rip off !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
i really like the size and i 'm a fan of the acers .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
though please note that sometimes it crashes , and the sound quality isnt superb .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i enjoy very much my new toshiba , purchased specifically for attending online schooling .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i always swore by pcs and would never consider this camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to read in there .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
he did n't work for sony , he was just approved to fix their crappy products .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when i got my phone back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then i started experiencing issues again , everything from programs and drivers failing again , to it powering off for no reason , to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
i would never buy a g3 again .####O O O O O O O O
think i would spend little extra to get a better made player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that is n't perfect about this dvd player is the speakers , they are not loud at all but i expected that .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
i have had my zen latitude for almost three years .####O O O O O O O O O O O
apple care included .####B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
overall , still a very nice machine .####O O O O O B-OP O O
i love this player , and use it everyday to do something , and never lets me down .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i lost two items i was working on until i figured out what was happening .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you 'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my children wo n't even use it for their school work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will also say it is much better than i expected !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
being virus-resistant is a huge plus .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O
the player feels good and i type just fine on it .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
i was told that it seems to be a multi - component failure .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cost is more as compared to other brands .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
i was considering buying the air , but in reality , this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient , even though it 's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
the screen is a little glary , and i hated the clicking buttons , but i got used to them .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
the built quality is really good , i was so happy and excited about this product .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O
i actually contact t-mobile before i started having problem and was given run around after i supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
if you want more information on this phone i suggest going to apple .com and heading towards the zen page for more information of the applications .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
on the twelfth day that i had the notebook , i decided to go to dell 's website and update it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and mine had broke but i sent it in under warranty - no problems .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
from the get-go , the m6809 was unsteady in its operation ;####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the only thing i would change about it is the notmad .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
it 's a great product for a great price !####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
after doing extensive research , macconnection had the lowest price on the 15 " zen i5 .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
in early may i got it back and this time i only had it back for 1 day before it had a new issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they " expedited " the repairs so i was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed , by a " senior tech " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
i took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and i finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
now for the hardware problems .####O O O B-ASP B-OP O
no complaints for this camera product .####O O O O O O O
i have aniphone , and ipad , so it just made sense to finish off the platform by adding the ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend this player to anyone looking to get an ipod who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
delivery was early too .####B-ASP O B-OP O O
looking online , many people are having the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O
very small and portable i 've had this dvd player about 12 hrs now and it 's better than expected .####O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the casing of the power cord fried and shocked my husband when he pulled it out of the socket .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
there was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system can n't be used with the ibook .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O
the operating system and user interface is very intuitive , and the large multi-touch optical zoom is amazing .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
( the sata controller is the control button that lets the cpu talk to the hard drive . )####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
it is very easy to navigate even for a novice .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
i have used both pcs and ipod and i have to say that i really really love my mac book player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
recently there are a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the past few years , i 've had terrible experiences with apex .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i gave it to my daughter because i just hated the screen , hated that it had no cd drive to at least play cd 's when i wanted to listen to music and do schoolwork .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is always reliable , never bugged and responds well .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O
it took me a while top get away from the land of pcs , but now that i have , i can ' t see myself going back to it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the advantages of owning ' a ' player are numerous .####O O O O O O O O O O O
pros : the zen notebook has a large battery life and you wont have to worry to charge your player every five hours or so .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zen had it crash , randomly turn off ,####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i would buy it again in a heartbeat !####O O O O O O O O O
better stick with another brand .####O O O O O O
again - windows based machines were not giving me anything to work with !####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
it allows you to automatically upload photos to your facebook account with one click .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
skype is just so dang cool with this machine too .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
they told me it was my loss even though it was the computer , not what i 've done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other controls include firewire 800 , gigabit ethernet , magsafe port , microphone jack .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
compared to similarly spec 'd pcs , this machine is good value , well built and works easily right out of the box .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
unless you need the bluetooth 3 .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i called their repair depot as was told they would send me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
best buy rocks !####O O O O
they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'll wait and save up for this dvd player .####O O O O O O O O O O O
thank god for " ctrl z " bottom line , i 've been using laptops since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i thought learning the retail section would be hard , but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with the player .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
also the battery is completely shot .####O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
the driver updates do n't fix the issue , very frustrating .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
i also bought one for my wife , and 3 for my office .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a very important feature is firewire 800 which in my experience works better then usb3 ( in pc enabled with usb3 ) i was not originally sold on the eax i felt it was inferior in many ways to usb3 .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
within 3 weeks the same issues started happening again .####O O O O O O O O O O
the fact that the screen reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury - when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or do n't want to bother them with bright lighting , it is very convenient to have a darker , softer lit screen .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i bought this player was the worst dvd player i 've ever bought .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
at 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was also able to install and use my photoshop and after effects programs easily .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
as with any player not purchased with software options , it comes with a lot of what i consider useless applications .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the cover for the dvd drive soon came off , too -- a mark of poor construction quality .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
replaced this one with the unit that was stolen , its a great computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i know apples are more expensive than pcs , but he thinks it is worth every penny .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they freeze all the time .####O B-OP O O O O
what can i say .####O O O O O
i remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever i look at the small scratch that it has caused .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no hassle and no complaints .####O O O O O O
as for the ipod , this is our 3rd apple computer in the past 2 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i really wish i had done this years ago .####O O O O O O O O O O
i do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however i would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design of the zen as it is one very large heat sink .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
stopped booting up less than a week after my one-year warranty was up .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
it took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that i owned the warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
works well , and i am extremely happy to be back to the remote control .####B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
long story , but after many calls to various offices , i was told that no one can override the depot and that managers do n't take phone calls or e/mails .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
just bit the bullet and bought this player hoping it will last a lot longer … .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't know why i did n't make the switch sooner... o ya because it 's expensive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
windows also shuts the computer down for no reason without warning .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
it still heats up like mad and i am unable to use it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after all was said and done , i essentially used that $ 450 savings to buy 12gb of storage , two seagate momentusxt hybrid drives and an owc upgrade kit to install the second hard drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
so happy with this purchase , i just wish it came with microsoft word .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
no startup disk was not included but that may be my fault .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
amazing performance for anything i throw at it .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
the broke-screen wash bag does n't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O
mac also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free .####O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i worked in it retail sales before .####O O O O O O O O
very nice so far .####O B-OP O O O
so glad i have gone this route!!####O O O O O O O
enabling the battery timer is useless .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i would never tell anyone to buy one either .####O O O O O O O O O O
it discharges too quickly .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
plus it is small and reasonably light so i can take it with me to and from work .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , one of the users mentioned how the edges on the zen is sharp , if you have money to spend on one of them incase shells , it does n't seem to be a problem .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i had purchased it from a major electronics store and took it to their service department to find out what the problem was .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
never been hacked .####O O O O
its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O

i want the portability of a tablet , without the limitations of a digital and that 's where the ipod comes into play .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is a bit quiet if you 're on a plane , this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
u can do what u want in just few seconds , even to start up your computer takes few seconds .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
this player is a great buy .####O O O O B-OP O O
but if you 're willing to pay another 200 dollar for a windows disc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i bought a notmad flash for it , but do n't always take it out ;####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O

you can find many phones with the same performance and even better with lower price , but you can not find the look , easy , applications , and the experience in mac .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
it 's annoying very much and i wo n't ever buy any acer products .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far , so good !####O O O O B-OP O
so i called , again .####O O O O O O
buy the ipod it 's a terribly great machine .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
but i was completely wrong , this camera is unbelievable amazing and easy to use .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
every time i log into the system after a few hours , there is this endlessly frustrating process that i have to go through .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i upgraded from a 5 year old player and was amazed to find out that this player is much slower then my old player .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i bought it for apex and so far it 's amazing !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
there is a blank lighted screen when i start and that is all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is probably an hour at best .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
3 ) horrible customer support####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
runs real quick .####B-ASP O B-OP O
i also wanted remote control , which this one has .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i especially like the 4x optical zoom .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
after that the said it was under warranty .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i would buy this lap top over and over again !####O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a much more streamlined system for adding programs , using the internet , and doing other things everyone does on a computer .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the notebook pc , the zen qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
garageband is easy to work with , like all the other apple applications i 've had experience with .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
this machine delivers .####O O O O
apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
thus , when you carry it at a slanted angle , the screen will " topple " or " slide " down , if you understand what i mean .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also the remote does not light up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the remote .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the baterry is very longer .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it made the computer much easier to use and navigate .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the bottom-line is that this player just is n't worth it .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the sound is nice and loud ; i do n't have any problems with hearing anything .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
screen is awesome , battery life is good .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the touchpad is very intuitive , so much so that i never want to use buttons to click again !####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
" i 've had it now about 2 months and absolutely love it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i initially purchased my zen pro 13 " in april , and i loved it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
adjust the sensitivity since it 's not that responsive to begin with .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O
the screen takes some getting use to , because it is smaller than an ipod .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
but the machine is awesome and ilife is great and i love snow leopard x .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
if someone called me an apple fanboy it would make sense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the not so good , i got the stock screen - which is very glossy .####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
could n't keep a page up you were working on !####O O O O O O O O O O O
i would buy one of these for every person in my office if i could .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
if you are looking for something reliable , this is the laptop for you .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i fell in love with it .####O O O B-OP O O O
, applications respond immediately ( not like the tired ms applications ) .####O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
i would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
few cameras to catch ;####O O O O O
laptop was in new condition and operational , but for the audio problem when 1st sent for repair .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
creative computers automatically " defrag " each time you start your computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service i received from toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
the controls in the player are hard to push .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
so far , so good .####O O O O B-OP O
the volume is really low to low for a player that is not expecting volume to be so low and i hate that about this player .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O
the os is fast and fluid , everything is organized and it 's just beautiful .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
and playinglists works like a charm .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
we both recently got new cameras .####O O O O O O O
it 's a lottery at this point as i have read that other have received new ones with the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the via/phone conversation is very useful when chatting with other techs in remote buildings on our campus .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , my sister got the exact same laptop ( since they were so cheap ) and after 8 months , the screen split in half just from everyday use .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
excellent led monitor and well equipped .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
i 'm very impressed .####O O O B-OP O
i will have to purchase spy ware or nortell for privacy protection .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
in the three years i 've had my zenxtra i have never had a virus on my computer , and i do a lot of work on the internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is easy to operate and i have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new rolls royce of cameras .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the battery life seems to be very good , and have had no issues with it .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i just bought this player 3 days ago .####O O O O O O O O O
awesome graphics !####B-OP B-ASP O
this computer was awful !####O O O B-OP O
if you have much higher expectations than that... i would look elsewhere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can not even read what i am writing half of the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i believe i purchased this in dec 09 for my primary work laptop which is used 5-10 hours a day , 4-6 days a week .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the speed is incredible and i am more than satisfied .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
could not keep up with me and finally the hard drive went out .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP O
did not enjoy the new flash card and touchscreen functions .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
about 1/2 of the sites i need to visit because of my work contain some type of flash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
good bye blue screen and critical errors!!!!####O O O O O O O
it is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O
good monitor and performed well .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O
i think the player is somewhere on the hard drive , but i rather have a hard copy .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a " different " computer .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i paid about 18000 for this phone because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they really screwed the pooch on this one .####O O O O O O O O O
i now realize that my $ 900 would have been better spent on a windows phone .####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O O
since i purchased my zenxtra , i have been very pleased with it , i can ' t read and a desktop .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
almost 4 years ago i bought what was then the current , up to date hp pavilion -- if i recall correctly , it was the dv 1300 t .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my husband got me this for chrismas after getting me a very expensive laptop that did not work after 2 days .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
- i propose that i can just swap the hard drives .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
besides , the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
exactly that , users .####O O O O O
and as for all the fancy finger swipes -- i just gave up and attached a remote .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i also love the design , the looks , the feel , and the fm/nx flash unit is wonderfull .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i do not like too much mp3 .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
i wanted it for it 's mobility and man , this little bad boy is very nice .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the zenxtra notebook , model nb 305-n410bl , is a great little computer .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i got what i paid for .####O O O O O O O
the first one i had was a 2006 model , not the ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the os is also very user friendly , even for those that switch from a pc , with a little practice you can take full advantage of this os !####O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i have in the past gotten superfine sandpaper and " fixed " the edges by rounding them off .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i was ready to take it back for a refund , but the geek squad came through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this g3 went bad on me after 3 days .####O O O O O O O O O O
then it ceased charging at all .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
hopefully my replacement is brand new .####O O O O O O O
but reasons we chose this apple computer .####O O O O O O O O
first the screen goes completely out .####O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
might have to buy one for me now , since i use it all the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has happened again and i 'm being told that it 's $ 175 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is the worst computer dvd player ever made .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i purchased this phone while on a business trip to keep up with my email .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the only time i have restarted is during system updates .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i want my l505-s5988 back !####O O O O O O
i am not much of a computer techie , so i can understand some of the internal problems , though i do have trend micro as an antiviral program .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
my one complaint with this dvd player that i 've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
received all four in good order ;####O O O O B-OP O O
on two occasions the computer s calendar told me it was 1969 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the remote , which generally felt okay even for someone used to a remote control , now looks terrible .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
no tutorials on the display .####O B-ASP O O O O
anyway , you can ' t even turn it off .####O O O O O O O O O O O
hopefully amazon will take this back .####O O O O O O O
- they reported that the computer is in their headquarters .####O O O O O O O O O O O
but , canon makes the switch from pc to mac easy .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
do not buy gateway computers they are junk and the warranty company is horrible .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i do n't know how i could ever live without my qosmio .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
owned apple computers and phones for as long as i could remember .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
the so called laptop runs to slow and i hate it !####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O
i will not be using that slot again .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O
i could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
every driver on the drivers/applications dvd is everything you will need for a reload .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
first , it does not have a remote slots to open the lid .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O
not something you want to miss out on!!!####O O O O O O O O
that seemed to solve the problem , till i wrote an article with semicolons in it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no more lenovo for me .####O O O O O O
once open , the leading edge is razor sharp .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
the exterior is absolutely gorgeous .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
this player serves all my needs .####O O O O O O O
only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation apple doesnt provide any kind of music player ( such as works for windows ) , but iwork is cheap compared to office .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O
i investigated netbooks and saw the zen nb305-n410bl .####O O O O O O O O O
the # 1 reason that is always repeated .####O O O O O O O O O
the computer is currently in west verginia doe to the method of shipping chosen by toshiba .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
in short i would never buy a compaq again .####O O O O O O O O O O
it really is perfect for work and play .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
and if you have aiphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
that defeated the whole point of this camera .####O O O O O O O O O
i realize that not every unit has this issue , but the ones that do can not be repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did a lot of research and ended up thinking this toshiba was the best one for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
additionally , there is barely a ventilation system in the computer , and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the g3 get very very hot , and in fact impossible to keep on lap .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
the battery is irreplaceable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the new operating system makes this player into a super ipad .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
finally , i could n't take it anymore and ordered my player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a great machine !####O O O B-OP O O
my wife also has problems with her asus - different model .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
instead of taking another chance on toshiba , i went with an asus g73jh-x3 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the local computer repair shops send out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or computer usually even the trouble some toshiba satellite .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase####O O O O O O O O O
i practically have a player with all the " fixes " they have done !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and if you are a game player it works with world of warcraft wonderfully .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this by far beats any computer out on the market today built well , battery life amazing .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
thank you so much for the great item .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
and the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and controls .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
not using wired lan not sure what thats about .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
harddrive was in poor condition , had to replace it .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i 've had to call apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful , english speaking ( from vancouver ) techs that walked me through the processes to help me .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i hate it !####O B-OP O O
obviously one of the most important features of any camera is the " human interface .####O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
by this time i was regretting ever seeing this machine on the shelf !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first i have been searching for long time before i decided to get this player####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe not the cutting edge ( satellite l455d ) but it is a workhorse .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery is not as shown in the product photos .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
apple is unmatched in product quality , aesthetics , craftmanship , and customer service .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is my first lg product .####O O O O O O O
the hewitt packard pavillion dv6700 was my first laptop , before this i had a dell desktop that i loved .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
but the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
however i chose two day shipping and it took over a week to arrive .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
still have n't solved this .####O O O O O O
go for it !####O O O O
i might have read it incorrectly , but better safe than sorry right ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on 3 july 2004 , i purchased this model at best buy for about $ 150####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
worse , for the price i could get a * netbook * that outperforms this machine .####B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the price was very good , and the product is top quality .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i 've already upgraded o mavericks and i am impressed with everything about this camera .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i can not even imaging going back to a pc after using this wonderful computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
she told me flatly , " it 's like that one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
btw , i checked online regarding the old g3 ' died ' and found that i was not alone , far from it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership , so it was covered by the applecare warranty plan .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i called apple and no solution .####O O O O O O O
features such as the dashboard ( allows you to view frequently used tools like a calculator , weather forecast , movie times , calendar , computer post its etc .####B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything i have tried has worked and i never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
we researched and found the best price at macconnection .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
it just works flawlessly !####O O B-ASP B-OP O
this dvd player is fabulous in both areas .####O O O O B-OP O O O O
it has a lot of memory and a great battery life .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
good luck with your purchase options .####O O O O O O O
but the performance of this player is a huge disappointment .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
i can ' t reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
but sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough ( this could be because im used to my lenovo 10 tablet now ) plus this is a great size if i want to unplug the flash card , flash , and monitor to take it with me when i take photos and video .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O

when i am next to my router on my hp i get full service , on my eee pc i get 3 bars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the size is perfect and i do not recommend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer , left right and front .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks .####O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
took me 11 hours , 3 trips to different fedex offices , and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse it support technicians in the world .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O

the g3 a dream come true .####O O O O O O O
they are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i could n't be more pleased .####O O O O O B-OP O
when i got the computer back and realized it still was not correct hp told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
it crashes , and when it goes flat , it just dies ( like a pc , maybe worse ) and i loose all my open documents !####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
summary : i 've had this phone for 2 months , out of the blue the power adapter stops working .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP O
since i 've had this player i 'd only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
- got it back 3 months later####O O O O O O O
very disappointed !####O B-OP O
this is my first computer purchase####O O O O O O
i paid $ 800 for this computer from my school campus bookstore .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i homeschool my kids and with this dvd player next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , a zen will be a different story .####O O O O O O O O O O
because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time , we are on the hook for the repair .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
tried to make a recovery disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i would not recommend this product to anyone .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
the toshiba satellite has been more than i expected for the price .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O
i had to have these computers in my school .####O O O O O O O O O O
i was n't a big fan of the netbooks but this one was very well designed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
my last computer , a zenxtra , cost only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
the macbooks worth every penny .####O O B-OP O O O
it 's not like i have used for half a year and then complained about it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i dual camera with linux and that other security-prone os and it performs flawlessly .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O
meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the aluminum body sure makes it stand out .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
shiny this camera is the best of the best !####O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
connecting to my wireless router via built-in wireless took no time at all .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i saw the apex mac at best buy and decided to get this as my replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i decided i wanted this player so i went into the bby store .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is really easy to use and it is quick to start up .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i tell everyone that i know , friends , family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i love the multi-touch trackpad .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the dvd drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .####O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
and that was the fourth timeive sent it to them to get fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm now trying to decide on another mp3 model .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i was so happy with my new camera .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
i am an info sys major in creative , so i started researching this issue on my own .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the 6610 one computer is a great computer .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
in addition , there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the os takes some getting used to especially after being a windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it !####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i sent it back and they lost it .####O O O O O O O O O
so not having my laptop was discouraging .####O O O O O O B-OP O
you just get a trial version either way .####O O O O O O O O O
not worth it one bit .####O B-OP O O O O
good luck .####O O O
so what am i supposed to do ? the lg service center can not provide me the " service " when it is called the " customer center " .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
it 's catatonic .####O O O O
then just the other day , my built-in flash unit snapped !####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
scroll time is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
love the speed , especially !####B-OP O B-ASP O O O
i have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had cameras 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
obviously we both got new macs .####O O O O O O O
took that one home , same thing .####O O O O O O O O
web browsing is very quick with safari browser .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
falls into the case .####O O O O O
yeah , to you .####O O O O O
but it came back in even worse shape .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
so , if you 're thinking of a player , i would heartily recommend the apple 13 .3 macbook pro notebook computer ( z0j80001 ) notebook for all your needs !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this dvd player !####O B-OP O O O O
the games included are very good games .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
runs hot i thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy this camera product .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
returning this as soon as i get out of work####O O O O O O O O O O
it is much better than the acer ultrabook i had before .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
who knows what will happen later on when they dismantle the whole damn thing ? so , i said i wanted a new set .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
user friendly , fast and high tech it is amazing !####B-OP I-OP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O B-OP O
one of the smartest thing i did was take my time to compare songs before making my purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this player was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run .####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
after years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting computer players , a good friend convinced me it was time to go the apple route .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have the a65 - right now it 's a paperweight .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
while it was barely a bargin in the begining , i would never purchase another ipod and would not recomend the zen brand to others .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
summary : they played games with me for the warranty period .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
somehow the system clock got messed up after reboot .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O
i had to call apple 19 times ( each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone ) , and take it to their store for evaluations , and diagnostics , 5 times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have never had any issues or problems with the zen pro so far , and it is still as fast as it was when i first bought it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a stop button .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
player is great , very quiet for all the typing that i do .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the program came with the computer and works beautifully .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive shipping to and from apex .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
and inconvenient !####O B-OP O
this player is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and the multiple page viewer ( allows you to press one button to see every separate page currently opened at the same time in one screen ) are great for those who are working non stop or just shopping online .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did n't like one thing about it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
what can i say , it 's the player .####O O O O O O O O O O
after much battling with hp i was able to return it 4 times for repairs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
did n't work when shipped from walmart .com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop ( same make/model ) .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the first time that i tried and owning a camera , although i have used 3 different cameras in the past 10 years , i find not much difference except of course for the screen size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it is easy to use , fast and has great graphics for the money .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i 've already recommended this laptop to a friend who eye 'd the computer when i took it out of my bag .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the quality , in general was less than the worth of the cheap camera .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
i found this player on sale for under 6000 at best buy which was a great deal !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the awesomest of the awetsomest .####O B-OP O O B-OP O
because he said that the hinge is under the button and they have to dismantle the whole thing before it can be tightened .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is easy to find documents , and keep them in one area .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
does everything i wanted this camera to do .####O O O O O O O O O
oh yeah , and if the fancy webcam breaks guess who you have to send it to to get it fixed ?####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this one has had the same effect .####O O O O O O O O
this is definitely a computer worth the money ;####O O O O O B-OP O O O
my only problem is i can not reg . the product key .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it had most of the features and all of the power that i wanted to replace my ipod machine .####O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
every day i had this computer , something failed on it .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
lots of preloaded software .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
not a bad phone , it 's a bit slow , but gets the job done .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i will not hesitate to recommend it to family and friends####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
it took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't waste your money or time .####O O O O O O O O
i liked the aluminum body .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is my second digital camera , and it 's better than ever .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
2 . the wireless card is low quality .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O
the receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
it did n't come with any software installed outside of windows media , but for the price , i was very pleased with the condition and the overall product .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the phone is two weeks late in delivery because hp forgot to complete the required import paperwork .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it does get hot when using on a bed or sofa and gets warm on a desk... this is in an un-air conditioned room in air condition it gets slightly warm......####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i expected so as it 's an ipod product , but i was glad to see my expectations exceeded , this is the player to buy right now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
returned it .####O O O
i love the operating system and the preloaded software .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is my first digital camera and i heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it !####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
it 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a notebook .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i shipped out on saturday , july 17 .####O O O O O O O O O
i will never complain about the price since i believe you get what you pay for and the zen was worth every dollar .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the speakers on it are useless too .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
i 've have n't had any major problems with this player except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the battery lasts as advertised ( give or take 15-20 minutes ) , and the entire user experience is very elegant .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
upon giving them the serial number the first thing i was told , was that it was out of warranty and i could pay to have it repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i use it mostly for content creation ( audio , video , photo editing ) and its reliable .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
cheaper than buying it @ apple too !####B-OP O O O O O O O
it is amazing .####O O B-OP O
performance is much much better on the ipod especially if you install an ssd on it .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
it was a great player , ran great and was really fast .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP O
my favorite by far , although the most expensive , was my sony .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
was searching online for a power supply when i found this site .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
we love the size of the screen , although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
was a great deal i will give that .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
the zenxtra just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to read this is the best price we can get for a great product .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
i have owned many computers and phones .####O O O O O O O O
buy this .####O O O
recommended to people as their first digital camera .####B-OP O O O O O O O O
but after using it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i grew up in a design family so it only made sense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this player is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
it works !####O O O
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happening so hopefully we can get this dvd player very soon !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh my goodness - i am not a happy camper .####O O O O O O O O O O O
easy to carry , can be taken anywhere , can also hooked up to printers , headsets .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you might think , i am new in this game , but i am a gadget lover , and have had more than 2 dozens dvd 's 15 years , and none gets this hot , that fast .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing is that the battery wo n't last more than 1/2 an hour .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
it is absolutely horrible to use , despite all its so called advanced features .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
kind of annoying , but i still love the ipod .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
the display is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
consumer report recommended this dvd player .####O O B-OP O O O O
it is so simple to use , i use it more than my ipod .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i purchased two laptops ( for my husband and 16 year old daughter ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this " never " happen...####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a hard decision for me since the zen pro looked so appealing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
fast , great screen , beautiful apps for a phone ; priced at 1100 on the ipod website ; amazon had it for 1098 + tax - plus i had a 10 % off coupon from amazon - cost me 998 plus tax - 1070 - otd !####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
if you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just buy the case and be happy , plus it looks nice , i bought the white one from best buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is amazingly long at 7 hrs and 5 hrs if you use it .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
while most people say that pcs hold functionality and value and macs are just pretty to look at , i think there 's something to be said about the simplicity of macs .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
the delivery was fast , and i would not hesitate to purchase this player again .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
and it did n't show up on the reciept , i do n't know how we ordered it online !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
i am glad i did my research .####O O O O O O O O
the other day i had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town - lots of people , little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
perfect -- thanks so .####B-OP O O O O
by the way teachers , they offer a discount which helps !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
no good .####O B-OP O
posted nov 8 , 2010 - two weeks ago i bought this notebook .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the i5 blows my player out of the water when it comes to rendering videos .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yet my player continues to function properly .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
i have had the luxury ( sarcasm ) of owning 2 of these laptops .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mousepad is a huge pain in the arse !####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
screen is bright and gorgeous .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
that being said after 2 weeks of owning every time i start it up now it gives me a black screen for 5-8 seconds stating pxe-e61 media test error check cable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that being said , it still runs video in full screen decently .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will not buy another one .####O O O O O O O
my smart phone is faster !####O O O O B-OP O
even though it is much more expensive than many pc laptops , it is worth the price .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i should have kept my big , old hp .####O O O O O O O O O O
i had a zen notebook , and it had absolutely no protection from viruses , spyware , malware , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this flaw unfortunately detracts from everything else apple got right with the phone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
quietest camera unit have ever owned .####B-OP O O O O O O
i have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP O
i do not plan on going back .####O O O O O O O O
they transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you can ' t understand what they are saying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what a waste of time it was to run a defrag on the pc !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like the brightness and adjustments .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
luckily , dell said they would replace my laptop with an ipod , but instead i got a refund and bought a ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the whole experience is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
:) anyway , in the past four years i 've had it zen once gotten a phone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was slow , locked up , and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O
small and still very powerful .####B-OP O O O B-OP O
i can ' t say enough of how satisfied i am with their product and help aftermarket .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i was looking for this player which is portable and has all the features that i was getting for .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
may be better for the occasional web surfer .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted to spend around $ 700 to $ 800 so i was directed to a nice looking ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
after 4 days , being denied 6 times and told off once , i managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
how does the power supply not work!!!####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
it has all the features that are necessary for phones and if not they are able to be added onto the computer .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( the ibook backup also uses a firewire connection ) .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
needs constant repair .####O O O O
then to make matters worst , there is noone that they can transfer you to .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a long and tiring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
he loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
while the player itself is alright , the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the back button drive .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the battery life was supposed to be 6 hours , but even if i ran off the battery with the high efficiency setting the battery would only last me on average about 2 .5 to 3 hours .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just what i needed for portable and my wallet too !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the g3 delivered as promised .####O O O O O O
i am also upset with cr for giving a good rating .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i 've had it for about 2 months now and found no issues with software or updates .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i would definitely recommend checking out this player if you are in the market for one .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that bums me out about this purchase is they released a newer updated mbp seriously right after i bought this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it should n't happen like that , i do n't have any design app open or anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
our apple 13 .3 zen notebook computer ( z0j80001 ) notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
where you click and hold and drag it picture , link , etc to where you want it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
took this dvd player on a vacation trip and i was able to do whatever i wanted to do without lugging a much heavier player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had this dvd player for three years now and still love it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i claim that this has no value to me , this player was new anyway .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it on their website!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the capabilities using that program alone made me want this player .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i 'm very happy with this machine !####O O O B-OP O O O O
i work on a pc at home and have used pc all through college .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got the black macbook two years ago and have never regretted it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that day !####O O O
i bought a logitech player set in anticipation for using with the ipod , but i use the touchpad 90 % of the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i am totally satisfied with my little zenxtra !####O O O B-OP O O O O O
it pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to scroll .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i have owned it only two months !####O O O O O O O O
this is the first apple product that i have purchased .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it will be returned in the state to which it was shipped michigan .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my sister is the electronics manager at wal mart and she says that hp is the best .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the best thing about this camera is the price along with some of the newer features .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the new g3 offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase this g3 in 18 months .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't really have a complaint .####O O O O O O O O
but in fact it is totally the opposite .####O O O O O O O O O
it is much faster than my desktop which is a core2 quad running at 2 .83 ghz .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
enjoy your sit down####O O O O
i 've had this phone for about a month now .####O O O O O O O O O O O
by the time i was finally able to get a work order to get it fixed i had been without my computer for almost a week while i was an online college student , so it was very inconvenient and i had to send it off and be without it while it was being fixed also .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
have returned that phone unused .####O O O O O O
the shop will definitely push the problem to the service center .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
one more tip , please purchase this model and get a 256mb flash card to save you $ 10####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
do you think the shop will give me a new set?? it will not !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a month later , we reinstall the internal nobe zen service .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i am just amazed .####O O O B-OP O
i will never go back to windows !####O O O O O O B-ASP O
far superior to my ipod .####O B-OP O O O O
i had to re-install windows within two weeks of the purchase and soon discovered cracks in the screen hinges .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
boots up fast and runs great !####B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O
startup in about 30 seconds , shutdown in 2-4 seconds , resume from sleep in 0-2 seconds .####B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
i returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund .####O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is a lot of the software i have wo n't work with mac and iwork is not worth the price of it .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
you can imagine that an expensive item as this player will not be left on your front steps , it needs signature to pove that you received it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was having a though time deciding between the 13 " macbook air or the macbook pro 13 " ( both baseline models , priced at 1 ,200 $ retail )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
acer was no help and garmin could not determine the problem ( after spending about 2 hours with me ) , so i returned it and purchased a zen r700 that seems even nicer and i was able to load all of my software with no problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
my zen is probably the best investment i have ever made .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
it suddenly can not work .####O O O O B-ASP O
simple to use , and great graphics .####B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
i give this player a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i 'm hoping the rest of the features will be the signature quality of this camera .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i am now frustrated that i still have to use my work issued windows phone !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love everything about it .####O B-OP O O O O
i currently own a lenovo camera as well as my zenxtra and each have their own strengths and weaknesses .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did not even have it a year .####O O O O O O O O O
the mbp i recieved was everything it should have been .####O O O O O O O O O O O
let 's just get this out of the way , i love apple !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great ( i even put it to the test by accident ) excellent innovation !####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i can ' t honestly say i was heartbroken .####O O O O O O O O O O
in the short time of one month since the 2012 zen was released there are well over 1000 posts regarding this issue and the numbers keep rising .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the unibody design is edgy and durable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
you will not regret it , promise you !####O O O O O O O O O
they sent out a sony ' certified ' technician .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
right size and weight for portability .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
its fast and another thing i like is that it has three stop button .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is still a fairly good upgrade to an ipod that was about 4 years old .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i had this phone for one month and had to send it in for repair .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you can afford an ipod , and are in the market for one , of course , then definitely go for this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hope this helped !####O O O O
it is trash !####O O B-OP O
not too much " junk " software to remove .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
they would repair one thing , send it back and it would still have the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hope to edit this in the next few hours , i am going to try to install my own copy of dual flash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is a great computer .####O O O B-OP O O
i never tried any external mics with that imac .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
so glad i did not waste money on a less than par product .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the graphics are stunning .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the zen notebook will not let you down .####O O O O O O O O O
when i called toshiba , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $ 35 for the phone call , even though they did n't offer any technical support .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it 's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
* = webcam is a bit laggy , not the greatest .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
i have a player as my regular computer , but found that disconnecting it and lugging it around was a drag .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
suffice it to say , my zen keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
it just works out of the box and you have a lot of cool software included with the os .####O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
i love the size of the computer since i play games on it .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
you will fall in love with it in no time .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
5 months dead again .####O O O O O
and it fits in my briefcase with ease####O O O O O O O B-OP
since then i have had minor problems with slow operation .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the upgrade .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
so if you move laptop a lot , it might get loose , however it sits pretty tightly .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
besides the great look , it is a great machine .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
i connect a lacie 2big external drive via the firewire 800 interface , which is useful for time machine .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is especially disheartening when apple prides itself as the choice of creative professionals .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price####B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP
this player is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the backlight function and not the full manual controls .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
support has been lackluster and now i just want a refund .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
no viruses !####O O O
it 's fast , light , and is perfect for media editing , which is mostly why i bought it in the first place .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the design is awesome , quality is unprecedented .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
i have had no problems with it unlike some hardware defects on past models .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
osx lion is a great performer . . extremely fast and reliable .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
the price premium is a little much , but when you start looking at the features it is worth the added cash .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
one suggestion i do have , is to not bother getting nomad 's rps plan expecting it will work just like you knew it to on the ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the use it was purchased for it is a good player .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
all was well .####O O B-OP O
all in all , i 'm incredibly dissatisfied with this phone , and with phones as a whole .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it was so exciting for me to unwrap my new player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this camera has shown .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O
yes , the mbp is more expensive than competing pc players .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
my only issues are : 1 ) the screen/video resolution wo n't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i have owned macbook pros since 2005 and this is the best yet !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc !####O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i 've had the zen since august 2009 .####O O O O O O O O O
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but you must get the 15 inch .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the music player has never failed me , and i expect it to be the same for the ipod as well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pretty much made sense to get a phone .####O O O O O O O O O
the flash is dead !####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i paid for extra memory and the 17-inch screen , as well as the top of the line dvd and cd burners .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
it still serves me well both in business and home needs .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the pricing is very competitive .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
do n't buy this model .####O O O O O O
no star for this trash . [...####O O O O O O O
as an owner of a zen satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which i am used to it being on the side .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love ths notebook .####O B-OP O O O
purchased for development purposes , but it has turned into my everyday phone as well for surfing , e-mail , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i also purchased office max 's " max assurance " with the " no lemon " clause .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
he 's thrilled with his new player .####O O B-OP O O O O O
you wo n't be disappointed .####O O O O B-OP O
runs smooth and quick .####B-ASP B-OP O B-OP O
with the needs of a professional photographer i generally need to keep up with the best specs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
this ai n't it .####O O O O O
and if you are switching from ipod i highly sugest this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
: - ) if you buy this - do n't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life , and you 'll be perfectly satisfied .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
it seems they could have updated xp and done without creating auto manual .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
who makes the unit that can ' t rest on your lap ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the layout of the zen is horrible and confusing ;####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
ok first .####B-OP O O
great machine if you want to drop the cash for one .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
just chill and enjoy .####O B-OP O B-OP O
now i know !####O O O O
it has no camera but , i can always buy and install one easy .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i just hope this expensive laptop does n't go dead like my friends... it did last him 5 good years before it bit the dust .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you are a person like me , more on the g2 , this camera has something for you too .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- when i started worrying for not hearing anything from them , i tried to call .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they do n't crash .####O O O O O
it is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an alienware camera machine .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are so many things wrong with this product , it just makes me want to set my self on fire !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got the blue screen of death the first month i got it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it would not let me connect to my wifi system where i lived .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use , stylish , fun , awesome computer .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O
also , it hardly ever crashes .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
i do n't like this company nor the zen brand , and i 'll never buy another one because i 've put more into it then it is worth .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was disappointed when i realized that the flash does n't light up on this model .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
it has everything you need to get the job done .####O O O O O O O O O O O
its by far faster and more stable then my pc .####O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O
there is a olia local reader which is perfect for typing in the dark .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
amazing product as you would expect from this camera .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the ipod macbook is the best investment that i have ever made .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
they sent it off and within 2 weeks i had it back good as new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
they were able to set-up with laptops themselves within a few minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O
when it broke i wanted another acer and chose the v5 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it turned out it 's not really a problem to have this camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the programs that come standard with the leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
only issue is that it is a little slow , and i 'm fixing that by adding more flash .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
also , the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i was even able to uninstall mcaffe and install one of my symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to return it for a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O
best buy - 5 stars + + + ( sales , service , respect for old men who are n't familiar with the technology ) dell computers - 3 stars optical scan book - owes a me a couple####B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
speakers too small to be of any real use .####B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
i always have used a tower home pc and jumped to the zen have been very satisfied with its performance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
still trying to learn how to use it .####O O O O O O O O O
even if apple replaces whatever needs replacing i wonder if , since i seem to be doubling the amount of time i get out of it each time it 's " like new , " i might have 8 months next time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
prior to this phone , i owned a powerbook g4 for 6 years ( quite a long time for a laptop ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , maybe i was just very unlucky .####O O O O O O O O O
( i found a 2gb stick for a bit under $ 50 ) nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours , or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also... - excellent operating system - size and weight for optimal mobility - excellent durability of the battery - the functions provided by the trackpad is unmatched by any other brand -####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
my zen g60-244dx died after only 16 months .####O O O O O O O O O
even though i had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i just recently had to ship my laptop back to apex for repair .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like the lighted screen at night .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
how the zen handles the repair seems to vary , some folks indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix , others had the repair done 5 times .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
extremely disappointed with the way it is .####O B-OP O O O O O O
$ 999 .00 tax free .####O O O O O O
the screen is huge and colorful , but no led backlighting .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
the g3 is really responsive .####O O O O B-OP O
so noise is reduced at least 50 % and the heat is much better , now it does n't feel hot but warm .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i have had my zenxtra i5 for a couple of days and have recycled all of my old pc phones .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
amazing machine .####B-OP O O
your cursor will end up all over the freaking place , , , it 's not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words , sentences , paragraphs because of this mousepad .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this is no exception .####O O O O O
it is fast and easy to use .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
good price .####B-OP B-ASP O
so this review might be a tad bit bias .####O O O O O O O O O O
windows xp sp2 caused many problems on the computer , so i had to remove it .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i have found also , it is very easy to be able to access wireless internet access ;####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
she can ' t tell the difference between it and her regular desktop system .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i will never buy another computer from this player ever again do to how awful it worked and how i was treated by the company .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i think just going from pc to phone has gotten me totally spoiled and can ' t imagine ever going back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i would highly recommend this one to my friends####O O O B-OP O O O O O
taking it anywhere was a pain !####O O O O O B-OP O
i love the dock where i can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program , and the program will simply open that file .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it 's fast and dependable .####O O B-OP O B-OP O
do you think i purposely " destroy " my zen , so that i can demand a new set ? do you read it 's fun to take public transport all the way to the service center and get a non-satisfactory solution ? or rather no solution .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
small enough to use on a long flight , light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips .####B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
for me i was lucky and a local store was selling them for $ 2000 off and best buy matched their price so i was able to buy one for under $ 1000####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
they claim that i should be happy because i am getting this dvd player to replace my two-month old player .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
believe me apple has a reputation .####O O O O O O O
i definitely suggest getting an extended warranty , you will probably need it !####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
size : i know 13 is small ( especially for a desktop replacement ) but with an external monitor , who cares .####B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
i let my friend borrow it , and she knows nothing about computers , and so used it with ease .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
thank you best buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software - you guys were great too !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
they 're absolutely useless , unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they say sorry out of warranty .####O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O
i am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great !####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the machine itself is alright .####O O O O B-OP O
the zenxtra designed to fail !####O O O O B-OP O
the g3 is way too overpriced for something so simple and chaotic .####O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP O
it 's color is even cool .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
of course , emachines can not be made entirely to blame for this camera 's woes ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the [ $ ] price ( special offer ) this is a great player .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O
took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
i love it and the change in lifestyle that came with it .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i now travel with this camera for my work pc .####O O O O O O O O O O O
pc never worked right even after bios fixed .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O
* 6th week * - they are not responding to my emails asking when they expect to dispatch the new unit...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was constantly having to roll back the computer after doing updates .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i respond that i do not have the old computer...####O O O O O O O O O O
- managed to send complaint email .####O O O O O O O
i continued to take the computer in again and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
for those that care about noise this thing does n't really make any ;####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
apple is one of the best computer companies in the country .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
however , if i sound enthusiastic about this , i am !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
when considering a player , look at the total cost of ownership and not just the initial price tag .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
programs would crash all the time , and it turned out to be a very unstable , unreliable laptop for me .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O
i have never had an experience like this .####O O O O O O O O O
do not purchase this player .####O O O O O O
not super light but still a good one .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
from the second you open the box you will fall in love with this player !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
it has been nothing but trouble from the time we bought it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted a simple , reliable phone .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O
it 's very annoying .####O O O B-OP O
it is extremely user friendly and intuitive .####O O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP O
if you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing controls and a dual core amd or intel manual .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
nothing about it that i do n't love , apple always makes a great product .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O
sent unit back and it 's been two months .####O O O O O O O O O O
another three weeks later i had my player back with a new mousepad , keys , and casing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
i wanted something that had a new intel core processors and hdmi port so that we could hook it up directly to our tv .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
of course , for a student , weight is always an issue .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O

this player is good for 10 days then it sucks for the rest of your life .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i bought my zen aspire custom made in june 2008 .####O O O O O O O O O O O
99 to fix it .####O O O O O
screen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive .####B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the construction function is among the best .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
would do business again .####O O O O O
well , i have to say since i bought this player , i wo n't ever go back to any windows .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this one still has the cd slot .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it was n't worth it .####O O O B-OP O O
i love the solid machined aluminum frame , and the remote is the best of any camera camera i 've used .####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
in my line of work , i often have to take work home , and this makes it so easy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i took the computer into best buy where i purchased it and they kept it over night to study it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bought it to use mostly for online classes .####O O O O O O O O O
i can ' t begin to say how disappointed i am .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i use this for my tutoring business , and since i 'm always bouncing from student to student , it is ideal for portability and battery life ( yes , it gets the 8 hours as advertised ! ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it did everything we expected !####O O O O O O
probably as good as you can get in a zen , does everything i ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
very good quality and well made .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O
the features are great , the only thing it needs is better speakers .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i 'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the ' old ' way - and apple does , indeed , have the better idea .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they offer the best warranty in the business , and do n't 3rd party it out like the ipod .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but for now , this camera is still a workhorse .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's not a wear-and-tear issue , not due to user carelessness and most importantly , they can ' t guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and i have to accept the outcome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
it is the best all around mac .####O O O B-OP O O O O
this is a great player and i would recommend it to anyone .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
this is an over-sized , 18-inch player .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
the only thing that i do n't like about my phone is that sometimes there are programs that i want to be able to run and i am not able to .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
i had to call apex and ask for a recovery disk because the computer does not come with one and completely redo it all .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'll rather be out of date then spend more money on this dvd player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's outstanding too .####O O B-OP O O
it will make life so much easier next semester , just wish i had it last semester!!####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
if you want a little more custom ability , drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of win 7 and grab a 2gb stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
not even safe mode boots .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
i do find that my macbook has a lot more bells and whistles than a normal pc especially if you enjoy technology , downloading pictures and graphic design .####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
this player is gorgeous .####O O O B-OP O
i was n't really sure i wanted to spend that kind of money !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in due course , i 'll remove the hard disc from this new mp3 player and dump it where it belongs - in the trash .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a great computer for light home use and business use .####O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
not good for a person who gets online daily .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O
on the bright side at least i was n't without my ipod long this time !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has plenty of memory , lots of hard drive , and great graphics .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
it 's so quick and responsive that it makes working / surfing on a computer so much more pleasurable !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
i would easly recommend this phone to a friend .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i am very pleased with my purchase !####O O O B-OP O O O O
this phone may be small but it is one heck of a power horse .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the phone takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average pc , but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , you have to adjust yourself to what it will do , not what you want it to do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this item is a beautiful piece , it works well , it is easy to carry and handle .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
anyone who is considering buying an ipod computer of any sort , i seriously suggest you look into buying a different brand .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
they removed them and returned the computer to me .####O O O O O O O O O O
this dvd player has a good reputation , my last computer was an acer .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
it was super easy to set up and is really easy to get used to .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
i am very satisfied with the phone .####O O O B-OP O O O O
2 ) blue screen first month####O O O O O O
very very disappointed !####O O B-OP O
the g3 very lightweight , can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i already own aniphone , and so the move just made more sense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could have purchased a cheap computer to do what i 'm doing now !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a user of this player , i will will admit that the zen has a better running system in which i found myself " getting the job done quicker .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes , a player can much more money than the average player out there , but there is no comparison in style , speed and just cool factor .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
- estimated time to fix it : 10 working days or less .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did not have to call the support line at all .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
it 's a bummer and one out of five is being kind .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this zenxtra is fast , powerful , and runs super quiet and cool .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
i like the operating system .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
it does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
after much effort and 10 days asus replaced it the wifi is very weak .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O
after that i turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i had read online that some users were having sound problems .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O

two , owning a 17 inch ipod gives the flexibility to sit anywhere you want without worry about bother anyone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i also like the auto " remote but these were really the only two things i liked about this camera .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i took it home and within 30 min , it was freezing up and did the " blue screen of death " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had a black macbook since 2007 .####O O O O O O O O O
another included program that is laughable is the chess game .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
i know what 7 hrs of battery looks like .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
do yourself a favor , this is not a fake story trying to hurt alienware...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will be patient for few months .####O O O O O O O O
i decided to buy a few notebooks for my nephews for xmas .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
the newer black flash took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick , but it is still a great notebook !####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
it is very slim , the in/out button is very much impressed with me .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
but for those of you that dont have a mac and are still on the pc 's this is a good foot in the door into the player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
also the display is exceptional !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
will probably never buy a player again .####O O O O O O O O
it still works and it 's extremely user friendly , so i would recommend it for new computer user and also for those who are just looking for a more efficient way to do things####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
but with a way bigger screen , and is able to connect to an hdmi .####O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
all apple associates are always willing to help you out with anything , no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
within a few hours i was using the gestures unconsciously .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O

this is one of the reasons i purchased it .####O O O O O O O O O O

why not 5 stars ?####O O O O O
great performance and quality .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O

great battery , speed , display .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i took it in to the apple store and guess what ? they fixed it , no cost out of pocket .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
there is no cd drive on the computer , which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had left my regular phone at home and needed something to use while out of town .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the paint wears off easily due to the controls being farther back than usual .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O
i was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing , i took it for granted that these features were standard .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the apple mc371ll/a 2 .4 ghz 15 .4-inch zenxtra notebook is a horrible waste of money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

so i got another ipod which i love !####O O O O O O O B-OP O
i ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back , but the return calls never came .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i can say that i am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O

for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
* 5 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - apple offers to send replacement after they receive the old computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can not be happier with the service or product .####O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O O O

can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this player .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the brand is tarnished in my heart .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
it has a very high performance , just for what i needed for .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
but other then that i would give this product a 4 in hafe stars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like to use it at the race track to handicap the horse races .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall for the money this is a good deal .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
great things come in small " packages .####B-OP O O O O O O O

i 'm just really happy that i waited to buy , because this thing kicks a $ $ !####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and that probably explains why i 've already had my sata controller go bad within a year of buying it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the phone 's body has n't changed since late 2010 - and for a good reason .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
there is nothing to complain about the system .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
it has come into good use for my finances , scheduling , my parents business expenses , and it is definitely amazing for playback .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
it has a 10 hour battery life when you 're doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of playback and movie playing it 'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
gave apex number .####O O O O
i bought this dvd player because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
player is not made for playback .####O O O O O B-ASP O
it 's super fast and a great value for the price !####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O
the apple will run internet explorer , but at an amazingly slow rate .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
i would recommend this product .####O O B-OP O O O
or the cursor would show up some place else .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
stay away from envy .####B-OP I-OP O O O
my bag just got a little lighter .####O O O O O O B-OP O
it played various games without problems and ran aero smoothly and flawlessly .####O O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP O
- apparently , contactus@euro .apple .com is not a good address to send complaints .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i am still in the process of learning about its features .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
this has happened three times so far .####O O O O O O O O
we decided we would try to trade-in our old ones .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i can have both osx and windows xp running at the same time !####O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i love the feel of the key board , as well as the trackpad .####O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
the only fact i dont like about apples is they generally use safari and i dont use safar but after i install mozilla firefox i love every single bit about it .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
the service tech said he had tried to duplicate the damage and was n't able to recreate it therefore it had to be their defect .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i go to purchase it on line , and i find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
otherwise , all other features are a 1####O O O O B-ASP O O O
now 17 months later they want ( would not say exact amount ) $ 165 .00 to $ 400 to fix the machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am stuck with this camera that i can not do very much with .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
then , one month after the warranty expired , the replacement charger went .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
the reaction of toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention pc 's require .####O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , there are major issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
breaking within 1 year of purchase and speaking to 4 + people to report the damaged part will be returned late !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the controls and the screen .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
the superdrive is quiet .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
hmmm - that high failure rate sure is n't reflected in the retail price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it 's so nice that the battery last so long and that this machine has the snow lion !####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i went with him and we picked this one .####O O O O O O O O O O
it is extremely fast and never lags .####O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O
i just can ' t fathom that the celebrated zen would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products - it only survives b/c its substandard tags are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising programs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i honestly love my g3 thats why i am a self proclaimed mac addict .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
seems like maybe a bad shipment from toshiba .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
this is my second player , and it is head and shoulders above my first .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also it is very good for creative students who just need a reliable , easy to use computer .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O
the little battery that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's wonderful for computer play .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
it is the best camera ever!!!####O O O B-OP O O
if you faintly come close to touching this thing while typing , all craziness may break loose .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am replacing the hd with a micron ssd soon .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
the computer did what it was not supposed to do , and i did n't know what to do....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
10 hours of battery life is really something else....####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
this was an update from an early zenxtra####O O O O O O O O
however , this player has a fatal flaw that i discovered merely a week after buying it .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O
we were occasional mac users before , but most recently owned a budget pc since it is what we could afford .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the remote control to me is what really stands out though , you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the remote unit , awesome thinking apple !####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
good player for the money .####B-OP O O O O O
one , owning this player is essentially a full production studio ( in the case of a player book a portable version ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
highly recommend for daily use .####O B-OP O O O O
i eventually did the migration from my imac backup disc which uses usb .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O
so needless to day , i 'm not happy .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
all the controls are much needed since this is my main computer .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the graphics and screen are stunning and although i was a pc person , i was able to understand how to use this phone fairly quickly .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
completely worth every single penny dime and nickel .####O B-OP O O O O O O O
i went to apex adobe lab service and found some suggestions to fix it .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
i have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free , even without the warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
i guess he was the technical person .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my pc did , and i have all of the programs that were on my pc .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
looks nice , but has a horribly cheap feel .####B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O
i use my friends and family 's $ 2000 phones and they are fast and reliable and phone , well , i 'll never buy or recommend an hp to anyone !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life sucked the juice from my zen when the extended life battery went out we were sol there to , so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O
only thing i would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
finally decided to try this player because there were too many choices of which pc 's to buy and everyone who had a player said " buy this player " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not enough time for me to give it 5 stars !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen is n't huge , but that does n't matter when i output media to the 50 inch lcd tv .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also does not have bluetooth .####O O O O O B-ASP O
it is extremely portable and easily connects to wifi at the library and elsewhere .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
it is held in place magnetically .####O O O O O O O
i think it was seventy nine plus tax .####O O O O O O O O O
i am loving the fast performance also .####O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O
it is super fast and has outstanding graphics .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
it is very fast and has everything that i need except for a word program .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it completely supports my home business and personal life .####O O O O O O O O O O
good for every day computing and web browsing .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i 've always used pc 's for work home and this is my first experience with a player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only gripe would be the need to add more controls .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this camera is a great price and has a sleek look .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
avoid this model .####O O O O
i do n't have that additional money right now , and therefore would n't had purchased it at this time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues .####O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
i got the first " blue screen of death " in the early part of july .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is very easy for anyone to use an apple and specially the zen pro notebook .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i have dropped mine a couple times with only a slim plastic case covering it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O
without a doubt , the * design * of this dvd player fantastic .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
my player is almost 2 yrs old and i have never had any problems with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this just keeps having it 's hard drive replaced !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
bottom line , if you can afford it , get this player !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate to say this , but if i could take this back to the shop and get my money back , then i would .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it can not save the correct date and time i set .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would totally recommend any other player over this pile of garbage .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i am first time apex buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the apex offers .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O
it does not even have the software to play a dvd now .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
creative did n't fix it .####O O O O O O
i would recommend mac , and do , to anyone looking to buy a new computer .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
some days it 's just blurry , some days the background of a lake and mountains .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
we use the built in tools often , itunes is open nearly every day and works great with myiphone .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i think that they are the best out on the market .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
this zen pro is a great product which can meet the needs of the average consumer .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i could n't afford a new player , so i bought a pc instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this was the same problem with my macbook ( circa 2007 ) that i just retired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the gray color was a good choice .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
fast , fast and fast , the web pages just fly by .####B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i am just one of the million customers .####O O O O O O O O O
here are the things that made me confident with my purchase : build quality - seriously , you ca n't beat a unibody construction .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
phones are usually used on the go , so why not give you a better battery ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i would definitely not go back to using this phone after using the phone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but let me tell you , the zen book player is so professional .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i wiped nearly everything off of it , installed openoffice and firefox , and i am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i should have bought one a long time ago .####O O O O O O O O O O
i still see the benefits of this camera when i do not know how to do something on this camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have a friend who has the other model and we put them side by side with the same dvd in ( battle of the smithsonian ) after on hour mine was at 53 % life left and his was at 69 % lifeleft .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a graphic arts a retired instructor i still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art.....####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O

yes , he is a self professed " apex snob .####O O O O O O O O O O O

at first !####O O O
i 'm going back to this player .####O O O O O O O O
finally was able to reach a young lady in california and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the technical support was not helpful as well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O
i can do everything i could before , only faster and more efficiently .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
also kinda loud when the fan was running .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O
they said it was a computer error on this type of computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when typing , letters and spaces are frequently omitted requiring the user to redo many words and sentences .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i left the place angrily .####O O O O O O
shipping was quick and product described was the product sent and so much more...####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
does a great job with video shot on a canon 5d mkii .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
and in 6 months , there have been no freezing up and no blue , purple , black or any other type of screen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the " abuse " is that i pushed the power plug in too hard .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
many thanks , overstock .com .####O O O O O O
overall , this camera is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i have recommended this player to everyone i know who is buying one .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O

i can ' t believe how quiet the hard drive is and how quick this thing boots up .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i tried giving it 0 stars but i had to choose at least one , but imo no stars####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it !####O B-OP O O
speaking of the browser , it too has problems .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
i have nothing to regret from this new product .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
my wireless system would not recognize speakerphone and i could n't get online to find out why .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
what 's really great about this product is you may have a family member who is computer illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on the player without any real supervision .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did not like my acer .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O
i can do pretty much 75 % of what i do on my player on my kitchen table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a bad experience but i played down its importance .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i saw this one , and i have the most difficult time trying to use them , they 've made great dust collectors , i hate putting this player down####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
i know that everyone thinks the phones are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial expense you 'll find that they 're worth every penny ( besides , there 's always the financing plan that best buy offers ) .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this phone was awful , i would never recomend it to another person .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O

return it .####O O O
i took the computer back in yet again except this time they kept it to send into their geek squad headquarters .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it feels cheap , the controls is not very sensitive .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
needless to say i told them no and have a nice day and hung up !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they definitely have a superior product !####O O O O B-OP O O
i would like to use a different operating system altogether .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
they are not .####O O O O
i am not happy at all with the product i purchased .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O

i was given a mac as a birthday present and could n't be happier with it 3 years later .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
that 's a huge difference .####O O O O O O
i have now had it for 1 .5 months and love it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
apple did a great job .####O O O B-OP O O
easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i love the form factor .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a mp3 player , it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get this player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
its not just slow on the internet , its slow in general .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O
i 'm going back to pc .####O O O O O O O
i my wife is also now the proud owner of a g3 as well !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i still have that stupid bluetooth player to !####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
its everything mac offers .####O O O O O
a second problem involves the battery which is advertised as having a storage life of 11 hours but when fully charged shows only 7 hours of service .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the lesson learned here is : it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand , since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible , as fast as they can , and in this day and age , the customer no longer is right all the times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since the machine 's slim profile is critical to me , that was a problem .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i loved it .####O B-OP O O
the graphics on this computer are also stellar - very clear and vivid .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-OP O
runs like a champ.....####B-ASP O O O
i love to use it it is easy and light .####O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
the thunderbolt port is awesome !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
but sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i had finally reached my limit and broke down .####O O O O O O O O O O
we figure that after everything his pc actually ended up costing $ 350 more than my original player .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
this player is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O
would pay more for it if i had too !####O O O O O O O O O O
not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
the zenxtra is very sturdy and versatile .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i recently purchased the phone and absolutely love it !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use .####O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
i would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
its also fun to use !####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i love the glass touchpad .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
apple no longer includes idvd with the computer and furthermore , apple does n't even offer it anymore !####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
such as pages , numbers , and so on .####O O O O O O O O O O
great deal on an amazing lap top !####B-OP O O O B-OP O O O
still pretty pricey , but i 've been putting off money for a while as a little zen fund , and finally got to use it .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in fact , somehow ( and i never opened it up ) some specks of dust or something got inside the screen and are now there permanently , behind the front of the screen , in the way of the display .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O
i have owned at least 4 to 5 phones and computers - but this is by far the most superior machine i have ever owned .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i have had it 9 months and it is already a $ 250 loss .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with awesome graphics and assuring security , it 's perfect !####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O
cons : price is a bit ridiculous , kinda heavy .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
logic board utterly fried , cried , and laid down and died .####B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
and i babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
would highly recommend this netbook though .####O O B-OP O O O O
i get a ton of compliments on its size , and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus , i can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you 're restricted to the width of your body for computing room .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
his language was so bad i swore i was taking the turing test , and it was failing .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i returned it to best buy on the ninteenth of april .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
dell sucks####O B-OP
the ac power port becomes loose over time####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O
which is what i did , check out my acer 5517 !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
words can not express how much i love my new player .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
but if you can ' t make your product last more than a year , you will not get my business again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a lifelong windows user , i was extremely pleased to make the change to this player .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i sent it back and found this time that the battery was faulty , so i got the zen and some other fixes they found .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , i had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my pc , but took the player to the conference .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in fact i still use many legacy programs ( appleworks , playlists , id3 tags , quicken , photoshop etc ) !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
sure hope best buy will replace it asap .####O O O O O O O O O
some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software , but there is no guarantee .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
this player looks great on the surface : 17 " inch screen , good price-point , nice appearance , boots up quickly , runs fast etc .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O
only good thing is the graphics quality .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the zenxtra 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
out of all the phones i have owned , this is by far the best !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i absolutely love this camera !####O O B-OP O O O
now , the next issue i had freaked me out .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i told them that i just received my brand new ipod but i was having issues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the zenxtra is no exception .####O O O O O O
very powerful especially for the money .####O B-OP O O O O O
i have never really been big on downloading anything so i was n't too worried about getting a song , plus i thought i was protected by norton .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
since i have always used apple products , the choice of the zen was obvious .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've almost have bought every generation of macminis since 2005 , and this one has n't let me down .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is also fast as can be... you get what you pay for... well worth the investment####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
heck , i like all digital computers , but they 're all way too pricey for the kind of economy the u .s . is going through .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally pulled the trigger and i am blown away by how much more i enjoy my computer tasks using the zen!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it would n't fit in most 17-inch bags .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
this dvd player is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
great laptop for school , easy to use for beginners in the household .####B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
then , within 5 months , the charger crapped out on me .####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O
winters is on it 's way and i imagine it will be cozy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
which i still use and have hooked up to my tv .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
we were pc users .####O O O O O
what a waste .####O O B-OP O
for some odd reasons the computer does n't recognize the operation system .####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
in summary , take your money elsewhere .####O O O O O O O O
i am forever changed and will no longer buy a windows based machine for personal use .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
images are crisp and clean .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
the majority of the reviews seem to be for the 13 .3 macbook pro model # md101ll/a .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
which is great i am running notmad explorer and scored a 5 .x on the index . i have never seen a windows machine have a total score in the 5 's .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i spent months looking for a good mp3 player for me and i finally found it !####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
tech support would not fix the problem unless i bought your plan for $ 150 plus .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i saw walmart had the same computer for about $ 650 but still knowing what i know now , i would not buy it at that price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary product key .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
bottom line , i doubt you 'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i have no idea how to burn cd 's or to use the web cam , just for starters .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
you just lose a customer .####O O O O O O
two of the times was in one month .####O O O O O O O O O
i took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of ipod .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
they are closed at 9 pm eastern .####O O O O O O O O
at least those computers did n't just die on me like this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this thing is a lemon .####O O O O O O
they replaced it and so far so good .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
if you get a lemon ( i have two thirds of my macs ) , you have to send it in for repairs several times before they will replace it , even if they have numerous problems with the same version of their computers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life was shorter than expected .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
i can guarantee this will be the last dvd player i will ever purchase !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen is nice , side view angles are pretty good .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
i am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when i got back in town .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't have stupid pop up windows ( even when i have pop ups blocked ) , i do have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download , and best of all i can run all the web programming software i need to use all at once without slowing me down .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not recommend this company or their products!!!!####O O O B-OP O O O O O
when the buyer returned it wal mart just boxed it , taped it shut resold it as new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we carry the zen around here and there , hence it 's kinda of irritating when the lcd just " slide " downwards .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
this is the first time for me to use this player and i 'm really happy with the move .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
well , they do n't care a bunch .####O O O O O O O O O
but until now , no complains at all .####O O O O O O O O O
it is in the best condition and has a really high quality .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
games being the main issue .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
a tip for people looking into this computer : do not buy it save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i can throw anything at it ( and i do ) , pictures , video editing , schoolwork .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm honestly afraid that it will burn me , it 's that hot !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and i have never had any issues with it freezing .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if that is the case for you , i would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate it .####O B-OP O O
i got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime i touched the lid , ( mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed ) but i suffered thru it and would constantly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
it 's absolutely wonderful and worth the price !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
it works really well .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
all in all great item highly recommend it .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O
out of the box i noticed how small it was and was exactly what i was looking for .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it has spent more time in repair shops than i can possibly recount here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought my first macbook after seeing the product demonstrated .####O O O O O O O O O O O
very disappointed becase i have had toshibas for years , and never a issue .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen shows great colors .####O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i am not one to throw things like this around but it is an ipod so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little , while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the computer blinks it shuts off at will .####O O O O O O O O O
actually , i had noticed the one on the sales floor also did n't have sound !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i understand i should call apple tech support about any variables ( which is my purpose of writing this con ) as variables could be a bigger future problem .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got this at an amazing price from amazon and it arrived just in time .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the zenxtra net book operates very well .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i hate it !####O B-OP O O
buying this dvd player would allow me to make the transition .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it works fine , and all the software seems to run pretty well .####O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
a great college tool !####O B-OP O O O
it was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O
was debating to buy one for months , checked out different stuff on youtube , and read different articles and debates , i just didnt really wan na spend the money but im glad that i did .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
being an apex user my whole life....####O O O O O O O
bought from wal-mart , i believe that this player was a repaired item .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am very happy i bought this player , well worth the extra money .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
buyers beware .####O O O
i 'm going to try and keep my old g4 on the road for as long as possible .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm so glad i purchased this player and not another pc!!!####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
loaded with bloatware .####O O B-ASP O
while many people brag about this being " intuitive " , it does take a little time to adjust to coming from this phone , but once i got the hang of it , i do n't want to go back .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bought this gateway m-50 or 150 early 2007 .####O O O O O O O O O

- called headquarters again , they report that tft panel is broken , should be fixed by the end of the week ( week 3 ) .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the performance is definitely superior to any computer i 've ever put my hands on .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
my husband purchased this player at the same time for about $ 300 less ( he got this player ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this computer does n't do that well with certain games it can ' t play some and it becomes too hot while playing games .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
another issue i have with it is the battery .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O
i 'm overall pleased with the interface and the portability of this product .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
stop living in the stone age and buy this player , you will not be sorry at all!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
because it is a defective product .####O O O O B-OP O O
i had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity , because it is very sensitive .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
no machine has come remotely close to causing as many problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has all the expected features and more + plus a wide screen and more than roomy play .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
deal of the year .####O O O O O
the only problem is a lack of screen resolutions !####O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the display is incredibly bright , much brighter than my powerbook and very crisp .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
it 's just what we were looking for and it works great .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
love it .####B-OP O O
they respond : " your dissatisfaction is noted "...####O O O O O O O O O
the one thing that apple does right is computers .####O O O O O O O O O O
she brought out 2 other identical netbooks and still insist that " it is like that one " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i only used it to browse the internet and and i dont know how many times it has spontaneously shut down and it is just a blank screen now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
this was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it freezes , and it always shows that there is an error , so i have to restart it a few times every time i use it .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and i would recommend this to anyone looking for an ipod .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
definitely worth spending the money on it .####O B-OP O O O O O O
usb3 peripherals are noticably less expensive than the thunderbolt ones .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O O
has a 5-6 hour battery life .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i had in the past a dell player and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
the zen , on/off button and a hdmi cable is all i need to get some real work done .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the system it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the people there just changed for me on the spot and i got a new arm piece and they did n't even request for a receipt .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
small screen somewhat limiting but great for travel .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O
i paid for this dvd player , but was sent a used one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if the number of patrons in the apple store are any indication , hp and other pc manufacturers need to take note .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the price is great for this model , i only plan on using it for media in the entertainment room .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there is nothing better .####O O O B-OP O
i needed a new computer for graduate school ( had never owned this player before ) , and the only reason i did n't purchase a player was because my school 's website strongly recommended students purchase pcs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i try to use it today and can ' t read the logon .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

might not make the avid gamer happy but i do n't really think that is what this dvd player designed for .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great pick for portability and affordability .####B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the zenxtra is portable , durable , and very capable .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O

this player has left me with a horrible taste in my mouth for mp3 brand products .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
very fast for my needs .####O B-OP O O O O
overall a nice computer .####O O B-OP O O
this player advertised as a 15 " but the casing looks like that of a 17 " .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
great wifi too .####B-OP B-ASP O O
it makes sorting out all those photos on my camera is a breeze , and organizing them by place , time taken , or uploading them to an online print shop , or upload them to flickr or facebook etc , is not hard at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
it 's light and easy to transport .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
seriously considering a larger laptop to replace the ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O
so then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back , but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened , and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair ( the price of the ipod ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
not to mention , the battery life is absolutely amazing .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
i am addicted to photo booth !####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
comfortable to use light easy to transport .####B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O
ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about this camera .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i returned the computer to apex and they kept it for 3 months .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the computer was shipped to their repair depot on june 24 and returned on july 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer is not repaired when it was returned .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i should have realized that trouble was brewing .####O O O O O O O O O
all i will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hunk of crap vaio .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
i have had a total of 5 different laptop from many different manufactures .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they gave me a hard time yet again , but their was a malfunction in the battery itself , it did n't die .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
if you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get this player !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is known as safari , and if you are doing any website work , you should know that many hosting companies do not support it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
these new problems were the final straws ;####O O O O O O O O
it is so great , i can hardly ever take my hands off it !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this player in order to replace my old zen laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
despite the inconvenient weight , i opted for the 12 cell battery .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
when this happened i would have to completely power off my computer and restart it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
about 2 months ago i bought the 2011 macbook pro , which was an upgrade from my 2010 zenxtra .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this system came loaded with bluetooth capabilities .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
acer has set me up with free recovery discs , when they are available since i asked .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it has had some problems .####O O O O B-OP O
again this is just my personal honest opinion .####O O O O O O O O O
i have had this phone for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
honestly , this is absolutely wonderful .####O O O O O B-OP O
not easy to carry .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
i just took the broken cords into the nomad store and they gave me new ones .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i dislike is the touchpad , alot of the times its unresponsive and does things i dont want it too , i would recommend using a remote with it .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O
with a healthy pessimism , i took the machine home and tried to find a flaw .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am so happy to have purchased this computer .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
it easily fits into most computer bags but does n't weigh down a backpack or satchel when being carried with spirals and/or textbooks .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the guy then said that if i insist on having the hinge tightened , they can do it for me but i have to accept the condition after the " repair " .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , i went back .####O O O O O O
i just love this camera , i just wish it were all silver or they had all black .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
high price tag , however .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
i have had no luck with staples or hp to resolve this problem .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
the price and features more than met my needs .####O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O
bought notebook 07/2009 .####O O O O

this laptop looked brand new and was shipped very quickly .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty would transfer to the new computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
my laptop with eax crashed and i did not want manual controls .####O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
finally set the unit back to hp after a month of hell .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i believe this is because i was more active than the average user , meaning i average about three " tabs " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i or my dad paid over twenty four hundred dollars for everything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also consider the ms office apps are all trial versions , hope you have your own copies .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
very fast and efficient !####O B-OP O B-OP O
and it has blue screen crashed on me twice .####O O O O O O O O O O
not with this camera####O O O O
then the hard drive failed ;####O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
it is fast and i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other problems .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
its worth every penny .####O B-OP O O O
also , the battery does not last very long at all .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O
my problem was with creative mediasource camera .####O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
but in resume this computer rocks !####O O O O O B-OP O
it has served my needs quite nicely for the most part .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
just be careful ; you always have to give up some good stuff for others .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
can never go wrong with apple products .####O O O O O O O O
i thought the white phones computers looked dirty too quickly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
seems a much more economical way to get into apple than their other computers .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
you wo n't have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient creative program that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a nice little gadget .####O O O B-OP O O O
at first when i got this product , i loved it .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O

i have had this dvd player for almost 6 months and can honestly say that i will never buy another computer if it is not an ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hope this review helps .####O O O O O O
exactly as posted plus a great value .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
this is perfect for her field .####O O B-OP O O O O
if internet connectivity is important i would recommend going with a zen net book for 50 bucks more , or buy a usb wireless card .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i was originally concerned that i could n't view work i had done in college on this player because of the pc formatting , but i was even more thrilled to learn of programs like ilife and iwork that allow you to convert your pc documents into readable files on this phone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mine came at $ 1 ,700 w/o a dvd burner ( ! ) .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
this system is not worth the money or trouble trying to get it fix .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i was told by many that it was a great computer , but we got one of these , and it worked great for one year , and as soon as the warrenty was up , then it got really bad .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
i looked around and based off my price / features comparison from a brand i trusted i landed here .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
no temporary replacement , they are out of replacements because " many computers had problems with the nvidia chipset " - inquired status of repair .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
came fully loaded - good .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
from the moment i opened the box to the present it has been a great joy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now that i have it i see that i really needed this for much more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the criticism has waned , and now i 'd be the first to recommend an air for truly portable computing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i went to my local best buy looking for this dvd player since mine broke .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then after paying for it to be examined i was told it was same problem cited on website but i 'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
but the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24/7 .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i am having a friend look at it , but will probably return it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is what they told me : it heats up , and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops , and simply categorize them as portables .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if i have a problem with any of my apple items i make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
emachines says they 're waiting for a part and refuses to replace entire unit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this zen white unibody .####O B-OP O O O O O
everything i wanted and everything i needed and the price was great !####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i was always against them but now i buying one i 'll never go back to pc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have only had pcs with windows before so this takes a little getting use to .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the retina display display make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
while the computer seems to be set up in a common sense way rather than in geek-speak , there are certain quirks that can drive you crazy trying to deal with the pc world .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i bought this one for my 11 year old and the zen air for my 9 year old .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got it for christmas , and i was so excited to set it up !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
but it has a major design flaw .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
i did swap out the hard drive for a samsung 830 ssd which i highly recommend .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
no problems , no lock ups , no disappointments .####O O O O O O O O O O
lastly , scroll time is annoying .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
first it burned or fused the power adapter plug .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the resolution is even higher than any other player on the market .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the zenxtra has been a huge disappointment .####O O O O O O B-OP O
mom , dad , brother , sister , you name it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
seriously why have n't they just replaced it by now .####O O O O O O O O O O O
lots of extra space but the player is ridiculously small .####B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i bought this dvd player for traveling , and it 's great - light , functional , and meets my needs .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
right out of the box , this little dvd player did everything i asked of it , including streaming the everyday video you 're bound to encounter checking mail and websites ( my biggest complaint previously ) .####O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
compresses itself and you can ' t use it .####O O O O O O O O O O

i bought this dvd player a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought mine from apple store the day it was released as amazon did n't have it yet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

now the machine wo n't connect and t-mobile says that they did replace the connection card in may but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now i 'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since i bought the netbook .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when i turned it on , nothing .####O O O O O O O O

also , i have had a lot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
probably the worst decision we ever made !####O O B-OP O O O O O
it does n't have a lot of frills , but i did n't need any , and being able to buy what i needed , and not more than i needed was very important .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* 3 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - visited machouse amsterdam .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i called t-mobile and they want me to be without my t-pod about two weeks while they look at the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer , they paid postage and whatnot , but when i got my computer back it still was n't running right , and now my cd drive was n' reading anything !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
so you do n't get frustrated the first few weeks .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
honestly , i am surprised no one else has mentioned returning theirs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
product support very poor as each phone call costs me long distan####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
not as fast as i would have expect for an i5 .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i love it !####O B-OP O O
each time taking about 1 day or so .####O O O O O O O O O
originally bought it for my wife .####O O O O O O O
i also did not like the loud noises it made or how the bottom of the computer would get really hot .####O O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
summary : hp knew they were shipping out bad bios and did nothing proactive to resolve it .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the screen is framed by half - to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary , reduces the screen size and increases the bulk .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O
do not buy you will be disappointed .####O O O O O O B-OP O
i love this computer .####O B-OP O O O
12 .44 seconds to playback .####O O O O B-ASP O
the extended warranty for the $ 4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the notebook would not turn back on again .####O O O O O O O O O
and plenty of storage with 250 gb ( though i will upgrade this and the manual . . )####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
that 's how frustrating it was .####O O O B-OP O O O
i have n't used the product long enough to write a detailed technical review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
will not every buy another lou####O O O O O O
the battery life is also relatively good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
with all the goodies inside this machine , it is a value .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

long story short , since i experience so many problems with my phone every since i bought it from day one , i did n't ask for a phone phone or a refund of what i pay for a crappy laptop , but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year , they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services , they finally gave in .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

, which apple does n't offer , is why i bought this dvd player at best buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this player was so challenging to carry and handle .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
creative fm radio makes this computer almost unusable for online service .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
after paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is frustrating that you can not get help after hours .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
as a die-hard windows enthusiast , i shunned the idea of this player until this point .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have been a pc user for a very long time now but i will get used to this new os .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
tried auto stability and hated it!!!####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
it is lightweight and the perfect size to carry to class .####O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
iphotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos .####B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
i pondered very long over this decision .####O O O O O O O O
but i do not like win8 .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
as well as having the plug in the computer come loose .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
i waited another month for approval and for them to " build " me an ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it all just makes sense .####O O O O O O
very nice unibody construction .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
this version of the zen runs on a third-generation cpu ( " ivy bridge " ) , not the latest fourth-generation haswell cpu the 2013 version has .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches , dents or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of damage could happen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was important that it was powerful enough to do all of the tasks he needed on the internet , word processing , graphic design and playback .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
the 17 in the zen has been a wonderful addition .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
so far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and i am praying it has finally stopped .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am a full mac convert now .####O O O O O O O O
get this instead , you wo n't be sorry .####O O O O O O O O O O
we also use paralles so we can run virtual machines of windows xp professional , apple mediasource , windows server enterprise 2003 , and windows server 2008 enterprise .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
most cameras and notebooks are difficult to key on .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i use that alot on my player , so i am adjusting to not having it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apparently there is a manufacturing defect , something with the amount of thermal paste .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it is light and the battery last a very long time .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
i think this will happen to any new version of computer/phone released and i need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
another great thing is the beast graphics .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it super shiny , so you can see the fingerprints easily .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O
i was wrong !####O O O O
very fast button up and shut down .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
it was a tough choice .####O O O O O O
the scroll wheel is fine - again , it 's a real touch button .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i 'm using this computer for word processing , web browsing , some manual , and i 'm learning programming .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
no big deal .####O O O O
i use the computer to basically check emails , surf the web , print coupons and for my digital papers .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i found it toughest to decide between zen ultra books and apple .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hard drive crashed as well , and i had to buy a new power cord .####O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it 's the player!!####O O O O
it 's slow and one day i hope to have the money to get rid of it and buy something else .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm still within the one year warranty but the repair " depot " has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not covered .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i thought it would be a simple job .####O O O O O O O O O
i 've been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
this unit is not .####O O O O O
the only bad part is the size / weight .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
) only to get another " hp/compaq " piece of crap .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
got another 1 , and same issue .####O O O O O O O O
i love metz flash but i can ' t give t-mobile any credit for that , unless you all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
at first , i feel a little bit uncomfortable in using the spinning wheel .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i thought the price was great for the specs .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O
this is not best buy 's fault .####O O O O O O O O
i had gotten this model for $ 1199 .00 on my state 's tax-free weekend and had a $ 100 off coupon for a zen at the local bestbuy !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you find yourself in the market for a mp3 player ( and have the money ) do n't exclude looking at the mbps .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new macbook !####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
this player does everything i need it to very well .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
being an apex user my whole life , it 's taking a bit of time to adapt to the os of a phone but i 'm finding my way around .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
there 's literally no way to make it sing with stop button .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
its a pretty decent computer .####O O O B-OP O O
going to bring it to service today .####O O O O O B-ASP O O
they were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have not have any problems .####O O O O O O O
- touchpad will take a bit of time to get used to .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
a lot of help they were n't !####O O O O O O O O
i own other macs but always find myself navigation to the zen to get my work done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
browsing , also , was no problem for me when i used itunes ( which usually slows down my pc ) .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
this is by far the best , most reliable computer i could find .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O
a great feature is the spotlight search : one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword , rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the investment of a new zen pro came at a price , but totally worth it for a good piece of mind .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O
the ilife software that comes with the phone is so simple to use and produces a great finished product .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
i swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy this dvd player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it definitely beats my old phone and the service was great .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming in front for headphones / mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction .####B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth , they come loose .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
there is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i reloaded with eax software , and the bluetooth and fingerprint reader ( software ) would not load .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
this was a great deal for a decked out dvd player .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
my last laptop gave me a constant battle even though it was also completely new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
getting the speakerphone function is a must .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
in fact , he said , about 10 % of their products fail .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
even set at the highest level , the computer sacrifices its queen every time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never buy anything from hp again !####O O O O O O O O O
i do n't want to run a computer ; i want to use a computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zen macbook pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to read this is the best price we can get for a great product .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
well , maybe more like week one .####O O O O O O O O
i sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall though , for the money spent it 's a great deal .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i just got this player for college , and so far i am very happy with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2 .5 hrs out of it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is the volume control .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
battery life could be better but overall for the price and the zen 's reputation for laptops it 's great !####B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
needless to say , not too happy with the product .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O
on my powerbook g4 i would never use the trackpad i would use an i/p button because i did n't like the track pad .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i was informed that i need to call some 0900 number first .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of course , i also have several great software packages that came for free including iwork , garageband , and imovie .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
amazing quality !####B-OP B-ASP O
i would recommend this phone to anyone searching for the perfect phone , and the battery life is amazing .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
and this is n't just my one experience .####O O O O O O O O O
i was so excited to receive the zenxtra l455 as a gift/bonus for some work i had done for a friend of mine !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the old unibody zen could fry an egg after a while .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
but it may be potentially hundreds or thousands in the near future .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall i am very satisfied with the purchase .####O O O O B-OP O O O O
i do admit it is pricey but the saying is really true with this zenxtra laptop ( you get what you pay for ) .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apple has a reputation and is well known for its easy usage .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
they also use two totally different operating systems .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it 's the inside that is truly wonderful .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
we purchase the dell xps several years ago for my home business .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
performance is good for the price .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O
first of all , i 've been an apex fan for more than fifteen years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm the pro-active type so i went off and did some preventative fixes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when the computer has been on for several minutes , it will occasionaly just go off by itself .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after replacing the spinning hard disk with an ssd drive , my player is just flying .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
we 'll save our money to replace it with this player again !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i edit and burn to dvd a lot of video , so i obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i was getting extrememly frustrated when i would want to do these simple taks that i would have to wait and wait and read for things to download or play that would clog up my pc .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was very excited because this was my first personal computer and i was purchasing it with my own money i had recieved from graduation presents .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm pretty sure when i bought it , my bank account went ' ouch !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all-in-all , i would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
:) great product , great price , great delivery , and great service .####O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
enough said .####O O O
what a great little camera .####O O B-OP O O O
i would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
when i finally held it in my hands i kissed it , yes i did .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got the new adapter and there was no change .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
finally , i should note that i took the fill-in flash from my old eeepc and installed it before i even powered on for the first time .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a huge monstrosity of this camera !####O O O O O O O O O
the cool thing about the ipod book was that i went on my honeymoon and shot a bunch of pictures and movies with myiphone , then i came back and put them onto the ipods and made a pretty good dvd movie with all the pictures and videos from my trip .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am very happy with this camera .####O O O B-OP O O O O
a lot of features and shortcuts on the g3 that i was never exposed to on a normal pc .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has far exceeded my expectations for power , storage , and ability .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
but i did n't want to spend another thousand on this player since my work already provides me with a pc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a laugh too !####O O O O O O
i had the computer for a full year and it was a new computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
soft touch , anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
this is quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands .####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it 's fast and has excellent battery life .####O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it is meant to be portable .####O O O O O O O
there has been no problem with anything .####O O O O O O O O
i 'm really frustrated by this experience .####O O O B-OP O O O O
i previously owned a zenxtra and it only lasted about 2 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my second apex book player .####O O O O O O O O
solution : it turned out to be pretty simple .####O O O O O O O O O O
its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i contacted apex about this situation and was given excuses , without results .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i can say is that the scroll wheel does n't work like it should all the time .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
the biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
i fell in love with the hp pavillion and that was my replacement and now i could not imagine going back to an acer at all .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh , boy !####O O O O
they were great in handling this problem , and i 'm looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by air sounds more like by truck to me .####O O O O O O O O O O
people know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was starting to boil .####O O O O O O
i just love my phone !####O O B-OP O O O
it is better than my old zenxtra .####O O B-OP O O O O O
i have full control at all times of what is going on - there is no control + alt + delete business anymore .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we have n't had any problems with it at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i love its solid build , light weight and excellent battery life ( for now ) .####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they update the next version on the zen book the quality of it will be better .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
ca n't wait until i go on vacation and take it with me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
pc users use the powerpoint program for slide-show presentation and creative users utilize keynote .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it 's a good fix , in my opinion .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i already have a zen bought last year that 's standard size .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
at first , the computer seemed a great deal -- seemingly high-end specs for a low , low price .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
the first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O
i had always used pcs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
but i 'm still learning so ca n't rate it yet for everything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
so ? how can you solve it ? c'mon , i just bought the g3 2 weeks ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they also have a longer service life than other computers ( i have several friends who still use the older apple powerbooks ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it could n't have been a better decision .####O O O O O O O O O
im glad that it has such great features in it .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
typically , when i purchase this camera , i always end up using an external flash for convenience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
buy this if you like being tortured , teased , frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old player .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very annoying .####O B-OP O
battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i will never purchase a player again ever .####O O O O O O O O O
it is really thick around the battery .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
so in late march , early april 2009 i was without it again for a couple weeks while i had online courses i had to complete and my fiance was in afghanistan and web conferencing was the best communication method we had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
this player has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks , and i would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
summary : after doing some investigation on the web , i have found that the zen nb205s are not chronically not booting .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no waiting to have my claim reviewed by someone in another state ( or more often , another country ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i first purchased this zen model " 1764 " on april 6 , 201####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also liked the glass screen .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the new os is great on this dvd player !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
when i called sony the customer service was great .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
graphics are clean and sharp , internet interfaces are seamless .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
( if you ever see the spinning beachball come up when you think it should n't , check the " activity monitor " app to see if the disk throughput has temporarily dropped to zero .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the unibody construction is solid , sleek and beautiful .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O
all the programs are easy and straight forward on the zenxtra it is clean and organized , which i always strive to be myself .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
but to be honest , the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think i ll buy this player next time .####O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
battery is lasting about 6 hours as i am surfing the web on sundays while checking football scores and watching funny youtube videos .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the creative 's zenxtra is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
now i have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the player !####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
i burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table , so i can place it there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all for such a great price .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i babyed the heck out of it and i still do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
that was my first apple product and since then i have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs i have bought .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
nice packing .####B-OP B-ASP O
setting would change for some reason , the screen size would change on it 's own , like the pixel sizes and whatnot .####B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
then on top of it all their customer service center is in the middle east .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O

the auto settings setting is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
if you have the money i suggest going for the i7 .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i dislike the weight and size , cubersome .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O
also is portable and reliable .####O O B-OP O B-OP O
before i begin , i will say that i am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this computer - i am an ipod fanboy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
only a few days after i received the computer back , the screen froze again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O
and the best part is that it even comes with a free printer ( when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course ) !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
microsoft word was not on it and i had to buy it seperately .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was at my door in less than 24 hours .####O O O O O O O O O O O
my phone now has no battery .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
my sister has the same player as me and she is in a band and uses garageband to record and edit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
quality display i love this , , it 's the only computer/printer we will buy .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
and not to mention after using it for a few months or so , the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you can ' t leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
love this camera wonderful price for what you get !####B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
if you want more information on macs i suggest going to apple .com and heading towards the zen page for more information of the applications .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it is the worst camera ever####O O O B-OP O O
i will never again buy another acer , not will i buy gateway , or emachine as they are all from the same company .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate , i chose the macbook player over the white macbook .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
so of course this one came through with the awesomeness !####O O O O O O O O O O O
it really is very light compared to other computers .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
unfortunately , apple 's quality has continued to slide .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i would recommend this acer to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i believe that the quality of this camera is worth the price .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
great product , very easy to use and great graphics .####B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i am sorry that i purchased this player .####O O O O O O O O O
reason why ? it 's because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that player , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10-20 % , unlike pc laptops which drop more than 80 % .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
super light , super sexy and everything just works .####O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
you will love this dvd player if you choose to buy it .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i tell everyone i see out looking to get this or another toshiba .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but this dvd player is the best !####O O O O O O B-OP O
they did n't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , hdd secures inside using rails , and there is only one set on the main hard drive .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i would never go back any more , i love this player so much and i would recommend it to everyone .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i was a little worry at first because i do n't have a lot of experience with os .x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
- they lost my laptop for a month####O O O O O O O O
( beware , their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a player is .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this lap top and the charge time dose n't last as long as they say it will more like 2 hours####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
so , the hard disk capacity really does n't matter to me .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
i bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is easily portable and i take it everywhere i go and might require internet access .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
more times that not the screen pops up saying i have a bad internet connection , or the page can ' t be displayed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
osx mountain lion soon to upgrade to mavericks .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
i love the easy to see screen , and it works well for work , personal or just play .####O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O
so i 'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all the above aside this machine rocks !####O O O O O O B-OP O
it 's fast , light , and simple to use .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
great os , fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the id3 and adding the thunderbolt port .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
you may just lose 1 customer for now .####O O O O O O O O O
- complied to their protocol , called number , made " case " , got an email address to send complaint .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
it 's just a great toy to have around .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
as a computer science student in college , i find that the portability , longevity , and ease of use of this player make me ( shockingly ) want to do homework more ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased an hp right after my high school graduation .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's even easy to hook up to other wireless networks .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
so this was great for me .####O O O B-OP O O O
love that it does n't take up space like a regular computer .####B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
here we are another year later and the g3 doing the same thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and , if you are going to deal with hp be careful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was really happy because it is a much better price on amazon .com than it was in the ipod store .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i am very happy !####O O O B-OP O
do i like the computer ? well , other than not getting phones , i guess it is ok .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
i bought this player the moment unibody product came to the market .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while we struggle with all the crashes and viruses , the kids computers stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for business !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
after using it for over a month , an issue started to surface .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm returning mine####O O O O
i love this product because it is toshiba and its 15 .6 " .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
but when i received my replacement , i made both recovery dvds ( 4 ) , and a driver/application dvd .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
info : windows failed to load because the kernal is missing , or corrupt .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
also , the extended warranty was a problem .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
they click .####O O O
built-in apps are purely amazing .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
this player was very easy to set up .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is a great value for the money .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
the cool thing about this is anyone can use it .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i 'm going to buy a logitech c270 .####O O O O O O O O O
if yo like practicality this is the player for you .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
i can ' t even install one of the 3 printers i have in my house so i am unable to print .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site , then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the minute you fire it up it 's all good , very easy user interface .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i had to return it because it would n't even start .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
but , for the cost this is a winner .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
minis make sense for a lot of people .####O O O O O O O O O
it is robust , with a friendly use as all apple products .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
another two weeks later and it was back in my possession .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
would buy 100 more of these if i could .####O O O O O O O O O O
i love it so much .####O B-OP O O O O
the screen resolution was exactly what i was looking for .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
i would recommend to any one looking for a first class computer !####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
it 's solid .####O O B-OP O
i look forward to years of use , it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
i reinstalled windows through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
i contacted t-mobile and they are giving me free recovery dvds , so do n't go and pay for them , just ask for them and they should give them to you .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen almost looked like a barcode when it froze .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
the computer could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never go back to a pc again !####O O O O O O O O O O
this little dvd player is helping me get work done !####O O O O O O O O O O O
i got this player on black friday .####O O O O O O O O
asked the customer service rep .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i did think it had a player because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i purchased .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i paid about the same for my zenxtra as i did for the compaq a few years back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that i have , is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can see why the have soooo much money .####O O O O O O O O O O
seems to me that 's the best way to get apple 's attention .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can ' t imagine my life without it anymore !####O O O O O O O O O O O
i do everything on this phone - check email , facebook , shop , check blogs , write papers , listen to music , and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i play a lot of casual games online , and the touchpad is very responsive .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
what a mistake !####O O O O
moving from a pc to phone has never been easier , and i 'm glad that i did it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i saved for this phone for 3 months and i can tell you personally it was worth the wait .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
never any doubt i would get a zen , just was n't sure which one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
he can ' t stand it .####O O O O O O O
1 ) payed $ 2200 for a " premium " laptop####O O O O O O O O O O O
the next time i had an issue my lightscribe would n't work .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about my camera .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
very light and easily maneuverable .####O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O
the internet speed is spectacular .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
now when i order i did not go full scale for the webcam or full manual i wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when i use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack zen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the third apex dvd player in our family .####O O O O O O O O O O O
one of the primary reasons why i purchased an ipad was to store photographs so that i could show to my customers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am a freelance graphic artist .####O O O O O O O
it was getting old and i needed a new school computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
with the upgraded memory , the zen never has an issue running many many applications at once !####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
let me tell you , this machine is great .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i opted for the squaretrade 3-year computer accidental protection warranty ( $ 1500-2000 ) which also support " accidents " like drops and spills that are not covered by applecare .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this is what i call a good after sales service .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i love it - never had a computer i was so impressed with - and i 've had a lot of laptops and desktops - this one is far and above the best one i ever had before .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O
his was worth $ 36 .####O O O O O O
and toshiba is a quality supplier .####O O O O O O O
it is more than enough computer to keep up with the needs of a high school student .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
from the build quality to the performance , everything about it has been sub-par from what i would have expected from this player####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
graphics are much improved .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
i picked it out because it was inexpensive ( $ 400 ) and i thought it would be a good , easy to use first player .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
and then , a guy came out to serve me instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
they sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
still , this camera is perfect for all day use at school and work .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
its not bad just very very annoying .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
i had my pc for 3 years and going to a macbook pro is like i leaped through time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but while this is one big advantage ( as you may know from the company s recent commercials ) there are other things to consider before going with this player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to pay $ 100 for a universal charger for this cheap $ 300 laptop .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
but enough about that , i am an apple convert for life .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , the player i purchased was also a point and shoot player and again , i have to say i hated it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it is a great computer for that and i have to say i 'm happy i switched .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
very very highly recommended .####O O O B-OP O
oh , it is such a great piece of equipment .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
runs good and does the job , you n't complain about that !####B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
this process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
( you may be reading one now !####O O O O O O O O
finally , the biggest problem has been tech support .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
they went through asking me open up various components , taking battery out , hard disk apart , and after 2 hours on player could not fix it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no cd rom in the new version there 's no way i 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
trashed it when i spilled a latte on it while writing at a cafe .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've installed to it additional ssd and metz flash .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never buy another apex computer .####O O O O O O O O
the manufacturer 's warranty only covers replacement/repair of parts .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
having had experience with a toshiba player , i was disappointed to find that the zen nb305 player has major problems .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
some features are n't friendly ( volume wheel , sound quality , etc .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
anyway , wo n't replace this player .####O O O O O O O O
i personally like the power button but needed a machine that delivered flash card while still looking professional in front of my customers .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i recommend this dvd player if you want the best laptop on the market .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
although i opted for the lowest end zenxtra this thing holds its own .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unable to scroll button this brand new player .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
but , at the same time they ( the company ) would not and could not do anything about my problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i waited and waited and no phone .####O O O O O O O O
by week two , my laptop had overheated and was completely dead even though i did not use it too much .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
they have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and i 'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
satisfy what i paid for it .####B-OP O O O O O O

it had a seventeen inch screen which i wanted , but i did n't realize at the time it would be such a monster !####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also got the added bonus of a 30 " hd monitor , which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh !####O O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O

it started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in ( mousing over the battery icon would read , for example , " 74 % , plugged in , not charging " ) , requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
a tip for people looking into this computer : do not buy it save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you pay for what you get for .####O O O O O O O O
my player is much more efficient than an ipod so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did n't because it was already over 2 ,400 dollars !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
after fumbling around with the os i started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100 % that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets , and rather quickly too .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
it runs perfectly .####O B-ASP B-OP O
shipped very quickly and safely .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O

in my opinion it was not as user friendly as i expected either .####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
i now own another hewlett packard .####O O O O O O O
with what i paid for this computer it should have had everything on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it looks and feels solid , with a flawless finish .####O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i 'll stick to toshiba .####O O O O O O
he gave me this pc about 3 years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is starting off good .####O O O O B-OP O
it is just slow slow slow fast slow slow .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
this was my first macbook purchase ever .####O O O O O O O O
i 've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it works perfectly .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
this dvd player is a great brand , even though i have n't had it for a long time , i am very happy with it !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
finally , i purchased a zenxtra .####O O O O O O O
if you ask me , for this price it should be included .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i can ' t imagine ever buying this player again !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the first time it crashed was maybe going on a year and a half of having it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when you call tech support you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its perfect , not much heavy .####O B-OP O O O B-OP O
you ca n't even get a satellite card which is why i bought to begin with .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
after doing cad work all day at work , using a higher end pc , i could n't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has good speed and plenty of hard drive space .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i bought it from hsn because it was " bundled " with extra software , but as it turns out , that software just crashes it more often.....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
has all the other features i wanted including a vga port , hdmi , ethernet and 3 mp3 players .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than apple 's previous laptops .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i have n't used it for anything high tech yet , but i love it already .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
another satisfied customer .####O B-OP O O
this hardware seems to be better than the imac in that it is n't $ 1400 and smaller .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it doesnt get hot like my pc , with technology always at the tip of our fingertips anytime i forget how to do something i just google it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even with creative storage , it always turned off when updates were needed and installed .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the battery gets so hot it is scary .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O
it lasted for many years of travel , kids and abuse and if i fired it up today , it would work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do not buy it !####O O O O O
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
not too expense and has enough storage for most users and many settings .####O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
everything is so easy to use , i/p button is just so much simpler than microsoft software .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
it 's fast , quiet , incredibly small and affordable compared to other digital models .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
the pictures are clear as can be .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
i got this one for thanks giving offer for $ 962 :) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that 's the downside for me .####O O O O O O O
well , i bought this player a month or two ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this player is bad from the first day of use ---- brought it back to store for return of money .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i 've owned every " pro " model apple phone for the last 8 years , this is by far the worst one i 'd ever had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
with this dvd player it comes with free security software to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
guess i 'll stay away from apex .####O O O O O O O O
the item received was exactly as identified .####O O O O O O O O
my toshiba did not have sound on everything , just certain things .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
now they are believers in the product .####O O O O O O O O
the ease of set up was terrific .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
yet , canon wo n't do anything about the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O
if it 's not shipped on the next business day , called on a friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
thank you for your great product !####O O O O B-OP O O
its still going .####O O O O
back she goes !####O O O O
i took it back to best buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the worst a player ever did to me was freeze up .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
runs very smoothly .####B-ASP O B-OP O
power supply went bad after 2 weeks --####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
great price free shipping what else can i ask for!!####B-OP B-ASP B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
in short , you could say your mac could become your best friend ( no intention of replacing rover your dog ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
using this machine is like a mild form of torture .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i am really heartbroken to have to post a terrible review .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the battery life has not decreased since i bought it , so i 'm thrilled with that .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i shopped around before buying .####O O O O O O
i do n't understand why only cell phone reception is included .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O
the latest and mightiest zenxtra 17-inch was bought by my university on the 30th of june 2009 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is basically the best camera camera camera have ever had or used .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
it is very durable , i am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O
it had some kind of pre installed software update that completely shut the computer down when you clicked it .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i plan on using this dvd player for a long time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't have any technical pearls to share .####O O O O O O O O O O
but with this player , the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
its a good player for its value .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
but the arm velcro is torn after one use .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
yeah , it 's super expensive .####O O O O O B-OP O
it was always getting froze up .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O
love it i 've always been an ipod fan boy , but never had the money to buy a zen only ipads andiphones , and this is my first ipod blew me away completely .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
system is running great .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ok , this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by this camera .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
so a couple of years later , i was a dumb phone girl and had to have the wireless internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they have more problems then a 1980 's computer .####O O O O O O O O O O
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
they say it could be the remote again , but dell####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
there is no way i will buy a lg product in the future .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the memory was gone and it was not able to be used .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
very satisfied .####O B-OP O
i know that asus is known for making motherboards , but this is the worst computer experience that i have ever had .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
web surfuring is smooth and seamless .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
an absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
this player is great !####O O O B-OP O
i bought this dvd player from best buy under a year ago to replace my old dvd players .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just a month and a half or two months ago , my vaio crashed again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
enough said .####O O O
have n't regretted it one bit .####O O O O O O O
sounds like a typewriter , but if you can get past that , this is a great player for a little money !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
after replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working ( 3 months of use ) which was frustrating .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this is my first apple laptop .####O O O O O O O
we now own two of these , identical .####O O O O O O O O O
i saved about $ 100 plus tax ordering on amazon and since i have prime , it arrived overnight for just $ 3 .99 more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
best buy laughed when i told them they should replace it instead of expecting me to be without a computer again for another couple of weeks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O
once i removed all the software the laptop loads in 15-20 seconds .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
i previously owned an older dell player that died after about 5 or 6 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far , a great product .####O O O O B-OP O O
apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , this dvd player is priced just right .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
only 2 scroll wheel... seems kind of limited .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
i 've always owned a pc and decided to try a macbook to see what it 's all about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this worked just fine .####O O O B-OP O
went silently .####O O O
this is now my 3rd dvd player and i really honestly love it !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the laptop in the sky!!####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is excellent , the display is excellent , and downloading apps is a breeze .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all i use the old flash card which works good .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
fits all my personal needs .####B-OP O O O O O
wonderful zooming .####B-OP B-ASP O
so it was only about 2 weeks ago .####O O O O O O O O O
premium price for the os more than anything else .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
the only solution is to turn the brightness down , etc .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i feel that enough people have macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far , it 's an average laptop - no better , no worse than the ipod i replaced .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
the second issue i had with it occured a month later and it kept overheating , even if on for less than an hour !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ultimate graduation gift .####O O O O O
i called back to ensure that received it , they had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
c'mon , lg .####O O O O
being a tech savvy , apple - product loving person , i 'm glad i finally got the zen !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
you will regret it if you buy any mp3 player .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
if you buy , pray you dont have major problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is the battery only last 1 .5-2 .0 hrs when not plugged in .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
they really do have the worlds very worst repair service .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it doesnt overheat or make any loud noises .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
i wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused , because they knew it was trouble .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
after replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working ( 3 months of use ) which was frustrating .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this computer i used daily nice compact design .####O O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O
i wish the zen would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the os at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the zen is a perfect supplementary computer to another phone or desktop ( my wife and i have another phone ) , or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can call apex and they want you to buy more software to fix it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i finally did it and this machine is the way to go !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , owing to these problems , i went out and got myself an apple zenxtra , which i am using with great satisfaction at this very moment .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
it gives me the power and speed that i need to run all the programs i use to edit .####O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i would highly recommend this macbook .####O O O B-OP O O O
at home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24 " lcd screen , so built in screen size is not terribly important .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i wish the volume could be louder and the phone didnt break after only a month .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
my friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance , picture quality , and ease of use .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
a scratch on a $ 1 ,500 dvd player unforgivable .####O O O O O O O O O O O
what 's also interesting is this survey changed my ratings the first time i submitted it in case it does n't keep what i put here are my ratings####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
much of which hp ended up paying for .####O O O O O O O O O
a mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
a little pricey but it is well , well worth it .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O
he has replaced his hard drive twice and ( of course ) has had to pay for antivirus software every year .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
i brought this player last friday , and originally it worked fantastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i 'm so happy with this dvd player !####O O O B-OP O O O O O
the book is useless .####O O O B-OP O
it is made better , thicker , and all out tough !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
( for those old enough to remember , it is similar to beta versus vhs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall very impressed , thank you apple and amazon !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i took it back for a full refund .####O O O O O O O O O
i have had some excellent computer and have found i had no idea what to do with them####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could n't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
this a starter notebook .####O O O O O
in november my computer messed up entirely and would n't power on after installing a windows update , i had to have my hd flashed and lost everything on it , including my school assignments and irreplaceable pictures that were only in raw format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason i was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installing it deleted my history .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not know for sure .####O O O O O O O
it also came with a built it web cam which is great because i can see an communicate with my family members back home .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
purchased a zen lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O
this notebook restarts every time there is a new update , so if you do n't save your files and information , everything will be lost .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
it is everything i 'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
its only crashed on me one time in the 3 months i 've had it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
taking notes , research , an online class and such and did n't want to spend too much on my first machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
will certainly use macconnection again .####O O O O O O
a couple things you should know :####O O O O O O O
so do n't get it .####O O O O O O
its seen in movies , sitcoms , prominent important people carry and use them and they are great !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it has a faster camera and more manual .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i am a wife , mom and a school teacher and a college student .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zenxtra is the premier choice for college students .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
pay attention to the specs if you want these options .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
note , however , that any existing magsafe accessories you have will not work with the magsafe 2 connection .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
other installed features , such as certain printer software , are also most attractive .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O
they are about the same size keys .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
if this is an improvement in customer service then i would hate too see what it was before !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had nothing but problems since the day i took it out of the box !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
never had a single problem , and do n't have to worry about viruses .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would like to tell you about the best phone i just got from mac .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
so buyer beware when buying toshiba####O O O O O O
this causes my wrist to scrape up against it .####O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm so disgusted that i wasted my money on this product .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O
i then upgraded to hard-drive dvd 's player .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
creative said i had done the damage .####O O O O O O O O
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the 15 " zenxtra .####O B-OP O O O O O
i saw the bad reviews from people saying to buy directly from apple and i was concerned but i took my chances and am overly impressed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i have used a couple of others on the job as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i upgraded it 's reception to 2gb , i am very happy with it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it seems to have some options that are installed but do not work like i thought they would .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my g3 is so much better looking and so thin !####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O
apparently well built and gorgeous to look at , the i5 macbook pro is a winning combination of price and performance .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
waited on getting this computer , but it has been a great change .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
plain and simple , it ( laptop ) runs great and loads fast .####B-OP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O
apex refused to give me a new one and wal mart refused to take it back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is really expensive though .####O O O B-OP O O
we purchased this as a back up computer after our more expensive hp needed to be repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am going to shoot next year and i needed a cheaper , quality computer for the goals i am trying to pursue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 ) laptop still did not work , blue screen within a week...####O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
customization on this player impossible .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
very happy with my 7th toshiba laptop !####O B-OP O O O O O O
i was a little weary at purchasing another zenxtra almost 2 years later but canon looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O
next , most zen laptop fans are on the bottom which is right on your laptop .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i was given a demonstration of sit/video .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
i will stack it up against laptops that cost twice as much any day .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
great battery life .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it blue screened on me without any warning , running simply basic chrome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

so when i had the money to buy one i bought other things instead... a 700 ipod some extra stuff with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

no phone is perfect , but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i considered i may have too much on the computer , but after looking , there was plenty of space and that is not the issue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
boot-up slowed significantly after all windows updates were installed .####B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O

all i can say is i am impressed .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
i would n't play a first-person shooter with this , mind , but if you wanted to run ms office , email , chat , download a video , listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store , and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful mp3 player to do that all in , i 'd highly recommend checking this out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O

maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unless you do n't care how long it takes to get going , find something else .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a waste of money from day one !####O O O O O O O O O O
easy to install also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for adsl cable or wifi .####B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

so , you can imagine how unhappy i am with this item .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
it is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good as new laptop but i am very satisfied .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

having usb3 is why i bought this player .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O
anyway , i can ' t even remember how i finally got it taken care of , but i was done with sony after that !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the only thing that can be updated is the video , other than that you 're all set .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O

sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
overall i feel this dvd player was poor quality , had poor performance , although it did have great battery life when it did work .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
from the start , when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even if you do n't do business , thats okay , it 's incredibly fast .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

within 3 weeks the same issues started happening again .####O O O O O O O O O O
the fact that the screen reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury - when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or do n't want to bother them with bright lighting , it is very convenient to have a darker , softer lit screen .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i bought this player was the worst laptop i 've ever bought .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
at 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was also able to install and use my photoshop and after effects programs easily .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
as with any player not purchased with software options , it comes with a lot of what i consider useless applications .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the cover for the dvd drive soon came off , too -- a mark of poor construction quality .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
replaced this one with the unit that was stolen , its a great computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i know apples are more expensive than pcs , but he thinks it is worth every penny .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us the zen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they freeze all the time .####O B-OP O O O O
what can i say .####O O O O O
i remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever i look at the small scratch that it has caused .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no hassle and no complaints .####O O O O O O
as for the phone , this is our 3rd apple computer in the past 2 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i really wish i had done this years ago .####O O O O O O O O O O
i do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however i would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design of the zen as it is one very large heat sink .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
stopped booting up less than a week after my one-year warranty was up .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
it took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that i owned the warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
long story , but after many calls to various offices , i was told that no one can override the depot and that managers do n't take phone calls or e/mails .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
just bit the bullet and bought the phone hoping it will last a lot longer … .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't know why i did n't make the switch sooner... o ya because it 's expensive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
windows also shuts the computer down for no reason without warning .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
it still heats up like mad and i am unable to use it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after all was said and done , i essentially used that $ 450 savings to buy harddrive mp3 player , two seagate momentusxt hybrid drives and an owc upgrade kit to install the second hard drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
so happy with this purchase , i just wish it came with microsoft word .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
no startup disk was not included but that may be my fault .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
amazing performance for anything i throw at it .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
the eax system does n't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O
creative also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free .####O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i worked in it retail sales before .####O O O O O O O O
very nice so far .####O B-OP O O O
quick and has it support chat system .####B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
so glad i have gone this route!!####O O O O O O O
enabling the battery timer is useless .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i would never tell anyone to buy one either .####O O O O O O O O O O
it discharges too quickly .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
plus it is small and reasonably light so i can take it with me to and from work .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , one of the users mentioned how the edges on the zen is sharp , if you have money to spend on one of them incase shells , it does n't seem to be a problem .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i had purchased it from a major electronics store and took it to their service department to find out what the problem was .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
never been hacked .####O O O O
its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
i 'm extremely happy with my purchase as i now have the portable power i have been looking for .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 ) cut my losses and sold it for parts####O O O O O O O O O O
there were no scratches or dents or any marks at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had it four months when my disc drive refused to open .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O
i love the apple products .####O B-OP O O O O
i want the portability of a tablet , without the limitations of a digital and that 's where the ipod comes into play .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is a bit quiet if you 're on a plane , this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
u can do what u want in just few seconds , even to start up your computer takes few seconds .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
this player is a great buy .####O O O O B-OP O O
but if you 're willing to pay another 200 dollar for a windows disc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i bought a 32mm flash for it , but do n't always take it out ;####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
my friends are in awe every time they come over !####O O O O O O O O O O O
screen - although some people might complain about low res which i think is ridiculous .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
- when battery life went to 4 hours or less , took it to the machouse amsterdam for repair ( 26th of august ) .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for this purpose , it 's great .####O O O O O O B-OP O
it is so much easier to use####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP
wonderful features .####B-OP B-ASP O
" this is n't a big deal , i have n't noticed the issue with dvds or other media , only through usb output .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
true quality at a great price !####B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
and dell and best buy both refused to take it back after i only had it for 1 hour....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices , and usb devices are recognized almost instantly .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
keys stick periodically and i havent had this player for 45 days yet .####B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
nothing wrong with this computer at all !####B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
after the bad experience with this player went back to compaq .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
my husband uses it mostly for games , email and music .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i cant believe hp put this out .####O O O O O O O O
without a big ol' clunky machine in my backpack , i feel like i can do programming homework anywhere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i work with kids and they love making short videos on there .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
you can find many phones with the same performance and even better with lower price , but you can not find the look , easy , applications , and the experience in this phone .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
it 's annoying very much and i wo n't ever buy any mp3 products .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far , so good !####O O O O B-OP O
so i called , again .####O O O O O O
buy the ipod it 's a terribly great machine .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
but i was completely wrong , this camera is unbelievable amazing and easy to use .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
every time i log into the system after a few hours , there is this endlessly frustrating process that i have to go through .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i upgraded from a 5 year old player and was amazed to find out that this player is much slower then my old player .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i bought it for apex and so far it 's amazing !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
there is a blank lighted screen when i start and that is all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is probably an hour at best .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
3 ) horrible customer support####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
runs real quick .####B-ASP O B-OP O
i also wanted eax , which this one has .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i especially like the notmad flash .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
1 . you can not change your manual function ( window 's 7 starter does not support that function ) .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O
after that the said it was under warranty .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i would buy this lap top over and over again !####O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a much more streamlined system for adding programs , using the internet , and doing other things everyone does on a computer .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the notebook pc , the zen qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
garageband is easy to work with , like all the other apple applications i 've had experience with .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
this machine delivers .####O O O O
apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
thus , when you carry it at a slanted angle , the screen will " topple " or " slide " down , if you understand what i mean .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the baterry is very longer .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it made the computer much easier to use and navigate .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the bottom-line is that this laptop just is n't worth it .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the sound is nice and loud ; i do n't have any problems with hearing anything .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
screen is awesome , battery life is good .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the touchpad is very intuitive , so much so that i never want to use buttons to click again !####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
" i 've had it now about 2 months and absolutely love it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i initially purchased this dvd player 13 " in april , and i loved it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
adjust the sensitivity since it 's not that responsive to begin with .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O
the screen takes some getting use to , because it is smaller than an ipod .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
but the machine is awesome and ilife is great and i love snow leopard x .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
if someone called me an apex fanboy it would make sense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the not so good , i got the stock screen - which is very glossy .####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
could n't keep a page up you were working on !####O O O O O O O O O O O
i would buy one of these for every person in my office if i could .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i would not reccomend anyone buying this player####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
if you are looking for something reliable , this is the player for you .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i fell in love with it .####O O O B-OP O O O
, applications respond immediately ( not like the tired ms applications ) .####O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
i would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
few viruses to catch ;####O O O O O
this player in new condition and operational , but for the audio problem when 1st sent for repair .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
creative computers automatically " defrag " each time you start your computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service i received from t-mobile went above and beyond the call of duty .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
the controls button are hard to push .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
so far , so good .####O O O O B-OP O
the volume is really low to low for this player was not expecting volume to be so low and i hate that about this player####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
the os is fast and fluid , everything is organized and it 's just beautiful .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
we both recently got new cameras .####O O O O O O O
it 's a lottery at this point as i have read that other have received new ones with the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the auto on/off button is very useful when chatting with other techs in creative buildings on our campus .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , my sister got the exact same laptop ( since they were so cheap ) and after 8 months , the screen split in half just from everyday use .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
excellent led monitor and well equipped .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
i 'm very impressed .####O O O B-OP O
i will have to purchase spy ware or nortell for privacy protection .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
in the three years i 've had the zenxtra , the zon had a virus on my computer , and i do a lot of work on the internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is easy to operate and i have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new rolls royce of cameras .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the battery life seems to be very good , and have had no issues with it .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i just bought this laptop 3 days ago .####O O O O O O O O O
awesome graphics !####B-OP B-ASP O
this player was awful !####O O O B-OP O
if you have much higher expectations than that... i would look elsewhere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can not even read what i am writing half of the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i believe i purchased this in dec 09 for my primary work laptop which is used 5-10 hours a day , 4-6 days a week .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the speed is incredible and i am more than satisfied .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
could not keep up with me and finally the hard drive went out .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP O
did not enjoy the new camera capabilities and touchscreen functions .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
about 1/2 of the sites i need to visit because of my work contain some type of flash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
good bye blue screen and critical errors!!!!####O O O O O O O
it is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O
good monitor and performed well .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O
i think the player is somewhere on the hard drive , but i rather have a hard copy .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a " different " computer .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i paid about 18000 for this phone because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they really screwed the pooch on this one .####O O O O O O O O O
since i purchased my zenxtra , i have been very pleased with it , i can ' t read and a desktop .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
almost 4 years ago i bought what was then the current , up to date apex pavilion -- if i recall correctly , it was the dv 1300 t .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my husband got me this for chrismas after getting me a very expensive laptop that did not work after 2 days .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
- i propose that i can just swap the hard drives .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
besides , the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
exactly that , users .####O O O O O
and as for all the fancy finger swipes -- i just gave up and attached a remote .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i do not like too much flash card .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i wanted it for it 's mobility and man , this little bad boy is very nice .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the zenxtra notebook , model nb 305-n410bl , is a great little computer .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i got what i paid for .####O O O O O O O
the first one i had was a 2006 model , not the pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the os is also very user friendly , even for those that switch from a pc , with a little practice you can take full advantage of this os !####O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i have t-mobile gotten superfine sandpaper and " fixed " the edges by rounding them off .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i was ready to take it back for a refund , but the geek squad came through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this netbook went bad on me after 3 days .####O O O O O O O O O O
then it ceased charging at all .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
hopefully my replacement is brand new .####O O O O O O O
but reasons we chose this apple computer .####O O O O O O O O
first the screen goes completely out .####O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
this camera meets every expectation and shooting flash is great !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
might have to buy one for me now , since i use it all the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has happened again and i 'm being told that it 's $ 175 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
screen , remote , and player : if you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a mac the beautiful screen , responsive island form factor , and fun multi-touch player is worth the extra $ to me alone .####B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
it is the worst computer dvd player ever made .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i purchased this phone while on a business trip to keep up with my email .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the only time i have restarted is during system updates .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i want my l505-s5988 back !####O O O O O O
i am not much of a computer techie , so i can understand some of the internal problems , though i do have trend micro as an antiviral program .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
my one complaint with this player is that i 've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
received all four in good order ;####O O O O B-OP O O
on two occasions the computer s calendar told me it was 1969 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the remote , which generally felt okay even for someone used to a remote control , now looks terrible .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
no tutorials on the display .####O B-ASP O O O O
i can ' t even turn it off .####O O O O O O O O O
hopefully amazon will take this back .####O O O O O O O
- they reported that the g3 in their headquarters .####O O O O O O O O O O
but , mac makes the switch from pc to mac easy .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
do not buy gateway computers they are junk and the warranty company is horrible .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i do n't know how i could ever live without my qosmio .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
owned apple computers and laptops for as long as i could remember .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
the so called laptop runs to slow and i hate it !####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O
i will not be using that slot again .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O
i could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
every driver on the drivers/applications dvd is everything you will need for a reload .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
first , it does not have a stop button to open the lid .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O
not something you want to miss out on!!!####O O O O O O O O
that seemed to solve the problem , till i wrote an article with semicolons in it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no more lenovo for me .####O O O O O O
once open , the leading edge is razor sharp .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
the exterior is absolutely gorgeous .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
this player serves all my needs .####O O O O O O O
i investigated netbooks and saw the toshiba nb305-n410bl .####O O O O O O O O O
the # 1 reason that is always repeated .####O O O O O O O O O
the computer is currently in west verginia doe to the method of shipping chosen by toshiba .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
in short i would never buy a compaq again .####O O O O O O O O O O
it really is perfect for work and play .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
and if you have aiphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
that defeated the whole point of this camera .####O O O O O O O O O
i realize that not every unit has this issue , but the ones that do can not be repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did a lot of research and ended up thinking this dvd player was the best one for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
additionally , there is barely a ventilation system in the computer , and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the g3 get very very hot , and in fact impossible to keep on lap .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
the battery is irreplaceable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the new operating system makes this computer into a super ipad .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
finally , i could n't take it anymore and ordered my player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a great machine !####O O O B-OP O O
my wife also has problems with her zen - different model .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
instead of taking another chance on this dvd player , i went with an asus g73jh-x3 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the local computer repair shops send out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or computer usually even the trouble some zenxtra .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase####O O O O O O O O O
i practically have an ipod with all the " fixes " they have done !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and if you are a game player it works with world of warcraft wonderfully .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this by far beats any computer out on the market today built well , battery life amazing .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
thank you so much for the great item .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
not using wired lan not sure what thats about .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
harddrive was in poor condition , had to replace it .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i 've had to call apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful , english speaking ( from vancouver ) techs that walked me through the processes to help me .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i hate it !####O B-OP O O
obviously one of the most important features of any camera is the " human interface .####O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
by this time i was regretting ever seeing this machine on the shelf !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first i have been searching for long time before i decided to get this player####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe not the cutting edge ( satellite l455d ) but it is a workhorse .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery is not as shown in the product photos .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
apple is unmatched in product quality , aesthetics , craftmanship , and customer service .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is my first lg product .####O O O O O O O
the hewitt packard pavillion dv6700 was my first player , before this i had a dell player that i loved .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
but the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
however i chose two day shipping and it took over a week to arrive .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
still have n't solved this .####O O O O O O
go for it !####O O O O
i might have read it incorrectly , but better safe than sorry right ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on 3 july 2004 , i purchased this model at best buy for about $ 150####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
worse , for the price i could get a * zen * that outperforms this machine .####B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the price was very good , and the product is top quality .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i 've already upgraded o mavericks and i am impressed with everything about this camera .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i can not even imaging going back to a pc after using this wonderful computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
she told me flatly , " it 's like that one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
btw , i checked online regarding the old laptop that ' died ' and found that i was not alone , far from it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership , so it was covered by the applecare warranty plan .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i called apple and no solution .####O O O O O O O
features such as the dashboard ( allows you to view frequently used tools like a calculator , weather forecast , movie times , calendar , computer post its etc .####B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything i have tried has worked and i never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
we researched and found the best price at macconnection .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
it just works flawlessly !####O O B-ASP B-OP O
this camera is fabulous in both areas .####O O O B-OP O O O O
it has a lot of memory and a great battery life .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
good luck with your purchase options .####O O O O O O O
but the performance of this player is a huge disappointment .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
but sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough ( this could be because im used to my lenovo 10 tablet now ) plus this is a great size if i want to unplug the core system , manual , and monitor to take it with me when i take photos and video .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
wow the new zen hanged as i tried to type this review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first things first , the zen has many applications to make life easier , unlike the windows computers .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O
when i am next to my router on my phone i get full service , on my eee pc i get 3 bars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the size is perfect and i do not recommend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
the player jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer , left right and front .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
none of the widescreen 's knew what they were doing .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks .####O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
took me 11 hours , 3 trips to different fedex offices , and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse it support technicians in the world .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
english must have been his third or fourth language .####O O O O O O O O O O
its as advertised on here.... . it works great and is not a waste of money !####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O
- called machouse amsterdam to ask for a temporary replacement , no answer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it can ' t get any better .####O O O O O O B-OP O
again , decent comp for the price , and i was in need of one quickly as my other player died on me .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sorry , newegg .####O O O O
i use a backlight but it does n't help .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O
this is a great little computer for the price .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
i ordered my 2012 ipod after being disappointed with spec of the new 27 " imacs .####O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i got this dvd player and he got a zenxtra####O O O O O O O O O O
i have used different zenxtra and i have to rate this one way above the rest .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O
the computer is a dream come true .####O O O O O O O O
they are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i could n't be more pleased .####O O O O O B-OP O
when i got the computer back and realized it still was not correct creative told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
it crashes , and when it goes flat , it just dies ( like an ipod , maybe worse ) and i loose all my open documents !####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
summary : i 've had this player for 2 months , out of the blue the power adapter stops working .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP O
since i 've had this computer i 'd only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
- got it back 3 months later####O O O O O O O
very disappointed !####O B-OP O
this is my first computer purchase####O O O O O O
i paid $ 800 for this computer from my school campus bookstore .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i homeschool my kids and with this dvd player next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , a zen will be a different story .####O O O O O O O O O O
because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time , we are on the hook for the repair .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
tried to make a recovery disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i would not recommend this product to anyone .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
the zenxtra satellite has been more than i expected for the price .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O
i had to have these computers in my school .####O O O O O O O O O O
i was n't a big fan of the netbooks but this one was very well designed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
my last computer , a toshiba , cost only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
the macbooks worth every penny .####O O B-OP O O O
it 's not like i have used for half a year and then complained about it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i dual camera with linux and that other security-prone os and it performs flawlessly .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O
meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the aluminum body sure makes it stand out .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
shiny this camera is the best of the best !####O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
connecting to my wireless router via built-in wireless took no time at all .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i saw the apex mac at best buy and decided to get this as my replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i decided i wanted a player so i went into the bby store .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is really easy to use and it is quick to start up .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i tell everyone that i know , friends , family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i love the multi-touch trackpad .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the dvd drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .####O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
no complaints with their desktop , and maybe because it just sits on your desktop , & you do n't carry it around , which could jar the hard drive , or the player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O
and that was the fourth timeive sent it to them to get fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm now trying to decide on another mp3 model .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i was so happy with my new camera .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
i am an info sys major in creative , so i started researching this issue on my own .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the 6610 one computer is a great computer .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
in addition , there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i dislike about this phone are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the os takes some getting used to especially after being a windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it !####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i sent it back and they lost it .####O O O O O O O O O
so not having my player is discouraging .####O O O O O O B-OP O
you just get a trial version either way .####O O O O O O O O O
not worth it one bit .####O B-OP O O O O
good luck .####O O O
it 's catatonic .####O O O O
this player is extremely different than any other player .####O O O O O O O O O O
playlists is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
love the speed , especially !####B-OP O B-ASP O O O
i have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
obviously we both got new macs .####O O O O O O O
took that one home , same thing .####O O O O O O O O
web browsing is very quick with safari browser .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
falls into the case .####O O O O O
yeah , to you .####O O O O O
but it came back in even worse shape .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
its white color is stylish for creative students and easy to take to carry and take to classes .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
so , if you 're thinking of a laptop , i would heartily recommend the apple 13 .3 zen notebook computer ( z0j80001 ) notebook for all your needs !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this dvd player !####O B-OP O O O O
the games included are very good games .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
runs hot i thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an apple product .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
returning this as soon as i get out of work####O O O O O O O O O O
it is much better than the zen ultrabook i had before .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
who knows what will happen later on when they dismantle the whole damn thing ? so , i said i wanted a new set .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
user friendly , fast and high tech it is amazing !####B-OP I-OP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O B-OP O
one of the smartest thing i did was take my time to compare laptops before making my purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this player was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run .####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
after years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting computer players , a good friend convinced me it was time to go the nomad route .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have the a65 - right now it 's a paperweight .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
while it was barely a bargin in the begining , i would never purchase another dell and would not recomend the dell brand to others .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
summary : they played games with me for the warranty period .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
somehow the system clock got messed up after reboot .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O
i had to call apple 19 times ( each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone ) , and take it to their store for evaluations , and diagnostics , 5 times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have never had any issues or problems with the zenxtra so far , and it is still as fast as it was when i first bought it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
player is great , very quiet for all the typing that i do .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the program came with the computer and works beautifully .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive shipping to and from apex .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
and inconvenient !####O B-OP O
this player is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and the multiple page viewer ( allows you to press one button to see every separate page currently opened at the same time in one screen ) are great for those who are working non stop or just shopping online .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
there is no need to purchase mp3 player , which saves me a lot of time and money .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i did n't like one thing about it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
what can i say , it 's the player .####O O O O O O O O O O
after much battling with creative i was able to return it 4 times for repairs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
did n't work when shipped from walmart .com but went into a store and exchanged for a working player ( same make/model ) .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the first time that i tried and owning a digital camera although i have used 3 different cameras in the past 10 years , i find not much difference except of course for the screen size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
after having two pc phones die with in the past 3 years , i was led to the 6610 display at best buy by the sleek design and promise of less tech issues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it is easy to use , fast and has great graphics for the money .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i 've already recommended this phone to a friend who eye 'd the computer when i took it out of my bag .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the quality , in general was less than the worth of the cheap camera .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
i found this player on sale for under 6000 at best buy which was a great deal !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the awesomest of the aweesomest .####O B-OP O O B-OP O
because he said that the hinge is under the button and they have to dismantle the whole thing before it can be tightened .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is easy to find documents , and keep them in one area .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
does everything i wanted this camera to do .####O O O O O O O O O
oh yeah , and if the fancy webcam breaks guess who you have to send it to to get it fixed ?####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this one has had the same effect .####O O O O O O O O
this is definitely a computer worth the money ;####O O O O O B-OP O O O
my only problem is i can not reg . the product key .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it had most of the features and all of the power that i wanted to replace my ipod machine .####O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
every day i had this computer , something failed on it .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
lots of preloaded software .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
not a bad phone , it 's a bit slow , but gets the job done .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i will not hesitate to recommend it to family and friends####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
it took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't waste your money or time .####O O O O O O O O
i liked the aluminum body .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is my second apex pro and it 's better than ever .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
2 . the wireless card is low quality .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O
the receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
it did n't come with any software installed outside of windows media , but for the price , i was very pleased with the condition and the overall product .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the phone is two weeks late in delivery because phone forgot to complete the required import paperwork .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it does get hot when using on a bed or sofa and gets warm on a desk... this is in an un-air conditioned room in air condition it gets slightly warm......####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i expected so as it 's an apple product , but i was glad to see my expectations exceeded , this is the player to buy right now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
returned it .####O O O
i love the operating system and the preloaded software .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is my first digital camera and i heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it !####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
it 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a notebook .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i shipped out on saturday , july 17 .####O O O O O O O O O
i will never complain about the price since i believe you get what you pay for and my zen was worth every dollar .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the speakers on it are useless too .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
i 've have n't had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the battery lasts as advertised ( give or take 15-20 minutes ) , and the entire user experience is very elegant .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
upon giving them the serial number the first thing i was told , was that it was out of warranty and i could pay to have it repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i use it mostly for content creation ( audio , video , photo editing ) and its reliable .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
cheaper than buying it @ apple too !####B-OP O O O O O O O
it is amazing .####O O B-OP O
performance is much much better on the ipod especially if you install an ssd on it .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
it was a great player , ran great and was really fast .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP O
my favorite by far , although the most expensive , was my sony .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
was searching online for a power supply when i found this site .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
we love the size of the screen , although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
was a great deal i will give that .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
the zen macbook player just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to ca this is the best price we can get for a great product .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
i have owned many computers and phones .####O O O O O O O O
buy this .####O O O
recommended to people as their first digital camera .####B-OP O O O O O O O O
but after using it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i grew up in a design family so it only made sense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this player is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
it works !####O O O
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happening so hopefully we can get a new one very soon !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh my goodness - i am not a happy camper .####O O O O O O O O O O O
easy to carry , can be taken anywhere , can also hooked up to printers , headsets .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you might think , i am new in this game , but i am a gadget lover , and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years , and none gets this hot , that fast .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing is that the battery wo n't last more than 1/2 an hour .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
it is absolutely horrible to use , despite all its so called advanced features .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
kind of annoying , but i still love the phone .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
the display is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
consumer report recommended toshiba .####O O B-OP O O
it is so simple to use , i use it more than my desktop .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i purchased two apex ( for my husband and 16 year old daughter ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this " never " happen...####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a hard decision for me since the zenxtra looked so appealing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
fast , great screen , beautiful apps for a phone ; priced at 1100 on the ipod website ; amazon had it for 1098 + tax - plus i had a 10 % off coupon from amazon - cost me 998 plus tax - 1070 - otd !####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
if you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just buy the case and be happy , plus it looks nice , i bought the white one from best buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is amazingly long at 7 hrs and 5 hrs if you use it .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the delivery was fast , and i would not hesitate to purchase this player again .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
and it did n't show up on the reciept , i do n't know how we ordered it online !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
i am glad i did my research .####O O O O O O O O
the other day i had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town - lots of people , little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

posted nov 8 , 2010 - two weeks ago i bought this notebook .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the i5 blows my desktop out of the water when it comes to rendering videos .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yet my mac continues to function properly .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
i have had the luxury ( sarcasm ) of owning 2 of these phones .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mousepad is a huge pain in the arse !####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
screen is bright and gorgeous .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
that being said after 2 weeks of owning every time i start it up now it gives me a black screen for 5-8 seconds stating pxe-e61 media test error check cable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that being said , it still runs video in full screen decently .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will not buy another one .####O O O O O O O
my smart phone is faster !####O O O O B-OP O
even though it is much more expensive than many pc players , it is worth the price .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i should have kept my big , old hp .####O O O O O O O O O O
i had a zen notebook , and it had absolutely no protection from viruses , spyware , malware , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this flaw unfortunately detracts from everything else apple got right with the phone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
quietest camera unit have ever owned .####B-OP O O O O O O
i have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP O
i do not plan on going back .####O O O O O O O O
they transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you can ' t understand what they are saying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what a waste of time it was to run a defrag on the pc !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like the brightness and adjustments .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
luckily , dell said they would replace my player with a new one , but instead i got a refund and bought this player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the whole experience is horrible so save up and buy a better player .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
biggest complaint is remote control .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
:) in the past four years i 've had it zen once gotten a phone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this controls is terrific .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
it was slow , locked up , and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O
small and still very powerful .####B-OP O O O B-OP O
i can ' t say enough of how satisfied i am with their product and help aftermarket .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i was looking for this player which is portable and has all the features that i was getting for .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
may be better for the occasional web surfer .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted to spend around $ 700 to $ 800 so i was directed to a nice looking hp player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
after 4 days , being denied 6 times and told off once , i managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
how does the power supply not work!!!####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
it has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( the ibook backup also uses a firewire connection ) .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
needs constant repair .####O O O O
then to make matters worst , there is noone that they can transfer you to .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a long and tiring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
he loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
the battery life was supposed to be 6 hours , but even if i ran off the battery with the high efficiency setting the battery would only last me on average about 2 .5 to 3 hours .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just what i needed for portable and my wallet too !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the computer was delivered as promised .####O O O O O O O
i am also upset with cr for giving a good rating .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i 've had it for about 2 months now and found no issues with software or updates .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i would definitely recommend checking out this player if you are in the market for one .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that bums me out about this purchase is they released a newer updated player seriously right after i bought this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it should n't happen like that , i do n't have any design app open or anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
our apple 13 .3 zen pro notebook computer ( z0j80001 ) notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
where you click and hold and drag it picture , link , etc to where you want it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
took this dvd player on a vacation trip and i was able to do whatever i wanted to do without lugging a much heavier player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had this dvd player for three years now and still love it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i claim that this has no value to me , the phone was new anyway .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it on their website!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the capabilities using that program alone made me want a player .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i 'm very happy with this machine !####O O O B-OP O O O O
i work on a pc at home and have used pc all through college .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got the black macbook two years ago and have never regretted it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i bought a logitech player set in anticipation for using with the mbp , but i use the touchpad 90 % of the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i am totally satisfied with my little zenxtra !####O O O B-OP O O O O O
it pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to scroll .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i have owned it only two months !####O O O O O O O O
this is the first apple product that i have purchased .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it will be returned in the state to which it was shipped michigan .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my sister is the electronics manager at wal mart and she says that hp is the best .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the best thing about this camera is the price along with some of the newer features .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the new mbp offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase this dvd player in 18 months .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't really have a complaint .####O O O O O O O O
but in fact it is totally the opposite .####O O O O O O O O O
it is much faster than my ip which is a core2 quad running at 2 .83 ghz .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
enjoy your sit down####O O O O
i 've had this player for about a month now .####O O O O O O O O O O O
by the time i was finally able to get a work order to get it fixed i had been without my computer for almost a week while i was an online college student , so it was very inconvenient and i had to send it off and be without it while it was being fixed also .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
have returned that laptop unused .####O O O O O O
the shop will definitely push the problem to the service center .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
one more tip , please purchase this model and get a dvd 's player to save you $ 10####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
do you think the shop will give me a new set?? it will not !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a month later , we reinstall the zen/ zen settings .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i am just amazed .####O O O B-OP O
i will never go back to windows !####O O O O O O B-ASP O
far superior to the ipod .####O B-OP O O O O
i had to re-install windows within two weeks of the purchase and soon discovered cracks in the screen hinges .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
boots up fast and runs great !####B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O
startup in about 30 seconds , shutdown in 2-4 seconds , resume from sleep in 0-2 seconds .####B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
i returned the 2nd dvd player a full refund .####O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is a lot of the software i have wo n't work with apex and iwork is not worth the price of it .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
you can imagine that an expensive item as this player will not be left on your front steps , it needs signature to pove that you received it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was having a though time deciding between the zen macbook air or the zonxtra ( both baseline models , priced at 1 ,200 $ retail )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
this dvd player is probably the best investment i have ever made .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had stop button####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP
it suddenly can not work .####O O O O B-ASP O
simple to use , and great graphics .####B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
i give this player a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i 'm hoping the rest of the features will be the signature quality of apple .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i am now frustrated that i still have to use my work issued windows phone !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love everything about it .####O B-OP O O O O
i currently own a lenovo player as well as my new macbook zen and each have their own strengths and weaknesses .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did not even have it a year .####O O O O O O O O O
the g3 i recieved was everything it should have been .####O O O O O O O O O O O
let 's just get this out of the way , i love apple !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great ( i even put it to the test by accident ) excellent innovation !####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i can ' t honestly say i was heartbroken .####O O O O O O O O O O
in the short time of one month since the 2012 zen was released there are well over 1000 posts regarding this issue and the numbers keep rising .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the unibody design is edgy and durable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
you will not regret it , promise you !####O O O O O O O O O
they sent out a sony ' certified ' technician .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
right size and weight for portability .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
its fast and another thing i like is that it has three playback capabilities .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is still a fairly good upgrade to a player that was about 4 years old .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you can afford a digital camera , and are in the market for one , of course , then definitely go for this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hope this helped !####O O O O
it is trash !####O O B-OP O
not too much " junk " software to remove .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
they would repair one thing , send it back and it would still have the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a great computer .####O O O B-OP O O
i never tried any external mics with that imac .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
so glad i did not waste money on a less than par product .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the graphics are stunning .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the zen notebook will not let you down .####O O O O O O O O O
when i called t-mobile , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $ 35 for the phone call , even though they did n't offer any technical support .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it 's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
* = webcam is a bit laggy , not the greatest .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
i have the player as my regular computer , but found that disconnecting it and lugging it around was a drag .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
suffice it to say , my zen keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
it just works out of the box and you have a lot of cool software included with the os .####O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
i love the size of the computer since i play games on it .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
you will fall in love with it in no time .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
5 months dead again .####O O O O O
and it fits in my briefcase with ease####O O O O O O O B-OP
since then i have had minor problems with slow operation .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the upgrade .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
so if you move songs a lot , it might get loose , however it sits pretty tightly .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
besides the great look , it is a great machine .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
i connect a lacie 2big external drive via the firewire 800 interface , which is useful for time machine .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is especially disheartening when apple prides itself as the choice of creative professionals .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price####B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP
this player is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the eax audio and not the full eax .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
support has been lackluster and now i just want a refund .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it 's fast , light , and is perfect for media editing , which is mostly why i bought it in the first place .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

for the use it was purchased for it is a good player .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
all was well .####O O B-OP O
all in all , i 'm incredibly dissatisfied with this phone , and with hp as a whole .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it was so exciting for me to unwrap my new player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O
yes , the mbp is more expensive than competing pc phones .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O

i 've had the zen since august 2009 .####O O O O O O O O O
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but you must get the 15 inch .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the reset button has never failed me , and i expect it to be the same for the ipod as well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pretty much made sense to get a mini .####O O O O O O O O O
the player is dead !####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i paid for extra memory and the 17-inch screen , as well as the top of the line dvd and cd burners .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
it still serves me well both in business and home needs .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O

i got the blue screen of death the first month i got it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it would not let me connect to my wifi system where i lived .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the button went on me , the fan went and the button go .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O
i would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use , stylish , fun , awesome computer .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O
also , it hardly ever crashes .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
i do n't like this company nor the zen brand , and i 'll never buy another one because i 've put more into it then it is worth .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was disappointed when i realized that the remote does n't light up on this model .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
it has everything you need to get the job done .####O O O O O O O O O O O
its by far faster and more stable then my pc .####O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O
there is a stop button attachment which is perfect for typing in the dark .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
amazing product as you would expect from this camera .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O
this dvd player is the best investment that i have ever made .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
they sent it off and within 2 weeks i had it back good as new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
they were able to set-up with apex themselves within a few minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O
when it broke i wanted another acer and chose the v5 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it turned out it 's not really a problem to have this camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the programs that come standard with the leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
only issue is that it is a little slow , and i 'm fixing that by adding more controls .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
also , the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i was even able to uninstall mcaffe and install one of my symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to return it for a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O
speakers too small to be of any real use .####B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
i always have used a tower home pc and jumped to the player and have been very satisfied with its performance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
still trying to learn how to use it .####O O O O O O O O O
even if apple replaces whatever needs replacing i wonder if , since i seem to be doubling the amount of time i get out of it each time it 's " like new , " i might have 8 months next time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
prior to this player , i owned a powerbook g4 for 6 years ( quite a long time for this player ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , maybe i was just very unlucky .####O O O O O O O O O
( i found a 2gb stick for a bit under $ 50 ) nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours , or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my zen g60-244dx died after only 16 months .####O O O O O O O O O
the auto mode is good but should have splurged for 8mb instead of 4mb .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
even though i had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i just recently had to ship my laptop back to hp for repair .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like the lighted screen at night .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
how toshiba handles the repair seems to vary , some folks indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix , others had the repair done 5 times .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
extremely disappointed with the way it is .####O B-OP O O O O O O
$ 999 .00 tax free .####O O O O O O
the screen is huge and colorful , but no led backlighting .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
so noise is reduced at least 50 % and the heat is much better , now it does n't feel hot but warm .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i have had my new zenxtra i5 for a couple of days and have recycled all of my old pc laptops .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

your cursor will end up all over the freaking place , , , it 's not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words , sentences , paragraphs because of this mousepad .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this is no exception .####O O O O O
it is fast and easy to use .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
good price .####B-OP B-ASP O
so this review might be a tad bit bias .####O O O O O O O O O O
windows xp sp2 caused many problems on the computer , so i had to remove it .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O

i will never buy another computer from dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how i was treated by the company .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the acer microdrive seems to always perform so much better than intel .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i think just going from pc to phone has gotten me totally spoiled and i can ' t imagine ever going back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i would highly recommend this one to my friends####O O O B-OP O O O O O
taking it anywhere was a pain !####O O O O O B-OP O
i love the dock where i can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program , and the program will simply open that file .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it 's fast and dependable .####O O B-OP O B-OP O
do you think i purposely " destroy " my zen , so that i can demand a new set ? do you read it 's fun to take public transport all the way to the service center and get a non-satisfactory solution ? or rather no solution .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
small enough to use on a long flight , light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips .####B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
for me i was lucky and a local store was selling them for $ 2000 off and best buy matched their price so i was able to buy one for under $ 1000####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
believe me apple has a reputation .####O O O O O O O
i definitely suggest getting an extended warranty , you will probably need it !####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
i let my friend borrow it , and she knows nothing about computers , and so used it with ease .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
thank you best buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software - you guys were great too !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
they 're absolutely useless , unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they say sorry out of warranty .####O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O
i am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great !####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the machine itself is alright .####O O O O B-OP O
the zenxtra designed to fail !####O O O O B-OP O
the g3 is way too overpriced for something so simple and chaotic .####O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP O
it 's color is even cool .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
of course , emachines can not be made entirely to blame for this camera 's woes ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the [ $ ] price ( special offer ) this is a great laptop .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O
but , buy this model and just purchase fm/ mp3 player ( 2x2gb for $ 92 or 1x4gb for 99 ) , and save yourself $ 100 than the other model with fm radio .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

i continued to take the computer in again and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
for those that care about noise this thing does n't really make any ;####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
apple is one of the best computer companies in the country .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
however , if i sound enthusiastic about this , i am !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
when considering this player , look at the total cost of ownership and not just the initial price tag .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
programs would crash all the time , and it turned out to be a very unstable , unreliable player for me .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O
i have never had an experience like this .####O O O O O O O O O
do not purchase this player .####O O O O O O
not super light but still a good one .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
from the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
it has been nothing but trouble from the time we bought it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted a simple , reliable laptop .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O
it 's very annoying .####O O O B-OP O
it is extremely user friendly and intuitive .####O O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP O
if you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing controls and a dual core amd or intel manual .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
nothing about it that i do n't love , apple always makes a great product .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O
sent unit back and it 's been two months .####O O O O O O O O O O
another three weeks later i had my player back with a new mousepad , keys , and casing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
i wanted something that had a new intel core processors and hdmi port so that we could hook it up directly to our tv .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
of course , for a student , weight is always an issue .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O

well , i have to say since i bought my g3 i wo n't ever go back to any windows .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this one still has the cd slot .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it was n't worth it .####O O O B-OP O O

i took the computer into best buy where i purchased it and they kept it over night to study it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bought it to use mostly for online classes .####O O O O O O O O O
i can ' t begin to say how disappointed i am .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i use this for my tutoring business , and since i 'm always bouncing from student to student , it is ideal for portability and battery life ( yes , it gets the 8 hours as advertised ! ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

very good quality and well made .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O
the features are great , the only thing it needs is better speakers .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i 'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the ' old ' way - and apple does , indeed , have the better idea .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they offer the best warranty in the business , and do n't 3rd party it out like the ipod .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sorry toshiba , but 1st impressions do count for something .####O O O O O O O O O O O
but for now , this player is still a workhorse .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's not a wear-and-tear issue , not due to user carelessness and most importantly , they can ' t guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and i have to accept the outcome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
it is the best all around mac .####O O O B-OP O O O O
this is a great laptop and i would recommend it to anyone .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
this is an over-sized , 18-inch player .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
the only thing that i do n't like about this phone is that sometimes there are programs that i want to be able to run and i am not able to .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
i had to call apex and ask for a recovery disk because the computer does not come with one and completely redo it all .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

if you want a little more custom ability , drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of win 7 and grab a 2gb stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O

this player is gorgeous .####O O O B-OP O

in due course , i 'll remove the hard disc from this zenxtra and dump it where it belongs - in the trash .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a great computer for light home use and business use .####O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
not good for a person who gets online daily .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O
on the bright side at least i was n't without my ipod long this time !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has plenty of memory , lots of hard drive , and great graphics .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O

i am very pleased with my purchase !####O O O B-OP O O O O
this phone may be small but it is one heck of a power horse .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
this player takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average pc , but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , you have to adjust yourself to what it will do , not what you want it to do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

2 ) blue screen first month####O O O O O O

this player is very lightweight , can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight .####O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i already own aniphone , and so the move just made more sense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could have purchased a cheap computer to do what i 'm doing now !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a user of this player , i will will admit that the zen has a better running system in which i found myself " getting the job done quicker .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
- estimated time to fix it : 10 working days or less .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did not have to call the support line at all .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
it 's a bummer and one out of five is being kind .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this macbook pro is fast , powerful , and runs super quiet and cool .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
i like the operating system .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
it does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
after much effort and 10 days the player replaced it the wifi is very weak .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O
after that i turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i had read online that some users were having sound problems .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
the zenxtra is light-years ahead of my old white plastic macbook circa 2006 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't waste your money !####O O O O O O
i was looking for something in between a regular player and a tablet and this is it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am so addict to this camera .####O O O B-OP O O O O
two , owning a 17 inch ipod gives the flexibility to sit anywhere you want without worry about bother anyone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued , apparently because of known camera problems .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
have one myself and love it !####O O O O B-OP O O
i also like the included remote control but these were really the only two things i liked about this player .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i took it home and within 30 min , it was freezing up and did the " blue screen of death " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if this player every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had a black ipod since 2007 .####O O O O O O O O O
another included program that is laughable is the chess game .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
i know what 7 hrs of battery looks like .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
this laptop has only 2 controls on the player , and they are both on the same side .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
do yourself a favor , this is not a fake story trying to hurt alienware...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it took mediasource support suite 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
it is very slim , the white chair is very much impressed with me .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
but for those of you that dont have an ipod and are still on the pc 's this is a good foot in the door into mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
also the display is exceptional !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
will probably never buy a player again .####O O O O O O O O
it still works and it 's extremely user friendly , so i would recommend it for new computer user and also for those who are just looking for a more efficient way to do things####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O

there is no cd drive on the computer , which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had left my regular phone at home and needed something to use while out of town .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back , but the return calls never came .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i can say that i am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i 'm very disappointed in dell .####O O O B-OP O O O

for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O

i can not be happier with the service or product .####O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O O O
this dvd player makes the zen seem slow .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
i definitely will buy this player again if and when the player ever fails .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this player .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the brand is tarnished in my heart .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
it has a very high performance , just for what i needed for .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
but other then that i would give this product a 4 in hafe stars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like to use it at the race track to handicap the horse races .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall for the money this is a good deal .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
great things come in small " packages .####B-OP O O O O O O O

it is the perfect size and speed for me .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
however the frozen screens kept happening .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
me and my boyfriend bought the gateway nv78 in nov of 09 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one year of trying to fix the computer by myself , with help of friends , and even help from computer experts i have given up on trying to find it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i 'm just really happy that i waited to buy , because this thing kicks a $ $ !####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and that probably explains why i 've already had my sata controller go bad within a year of buying it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the phone 's body has n't changed since late 2010 - and for a good reason .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O

it has a 10 hour battery life when you 're doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of player and movie playing it 'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O

i am still in the process of learning about its features .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
this has happened three times so far .####O O O O O O O O
we decided we would try to trade-in our old ones .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i can have both osx and windows xp running at the same time !####O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i love the feel of the key board , as well as the trackpad .####O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
the only fact i dont like about apples is they generally use safari and i dont use safar but after i install mozilla firefox i love every single bit about it .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
the service tech said he had tried to duplicate the damage and was n't able to recreate it therefore it had to be their defect .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i go to purchase it on line , and i find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
otherwise , all other features are a 1####O O O O B-ASP O O O
now 17 months later they want ( would not say exact amount ) $ 165 .00 to $ 400 to fix the machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am stuck with a camera phone i can not do very much with .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
then , one month after the warranty expired , the replacement charger went .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
the reaction of the zen is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention pc 's require .####O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , there are major issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
breaking within 1 year of purchase and speaking to 4 + people to report the damaged part will be returned late !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the player and the screen .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
the superdrive is quiet .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
hmmm - that high failure rate sure is n't reflected in the retail price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

i went with him and we picked this one .####O O O O O O O O O O
it is extremely fast and never lags .####O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O
i just can ' t fathom that the celebrated dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products - it only survives b/c its substandard laptops are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising programs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i honestly love this player , thats why i am a self proclaimed apex addict .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seems like maybe a bad shipment from toshiba .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
this is my second laptop , and it is head and shoulders above my first .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable , easy to use computer .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O
the little battery that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's wonderful for computer play .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
it is the best camera ever!!!####O O O B-OP O O
if you faintly come close to touching this thing while typing , all craziness may break loose .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am replacing the hd with a micron ssd soon .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
the computer did what it was not supposed to do , and i did n't know what to do....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
10 hours of battery life is really something else....####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
this was an update from an early zenxtra####O O O O O O O O
however , this player has a fatal flaw that i discovered merely a week after buying it .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O
we were occasional mac users before , but most recently owned a budget pc since it is what we could afford .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the reception system to me is what really stands out though , you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the remote control , awesome thinking apple !####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
good camera for the money .####B-OP O O O O O
one , owning this player is essentially a full production studio ( in the case of an ipod book a portable version ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
highly recommend for daily use .####O B-OP O O O O
i eventually did the migration from my imac backup disc which uses usb .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O
so needless to day , i 'm not happy .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
all the controls are much needed since this is my main computer .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the graphics and screen are stunning and although i was an ipod person , i was able to understand how to use a phone fairly quickly .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
completely worth every single penny dime and nickel .####O B-OP O O O O O O O
i have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free , even without the warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
i guess he was the technical person .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my pc did , and i have all of the programs that were on my pc .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
looks nice , but has a horribly cheap feel .####B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O
i use my friends and family 's $ 2000 phones and they are fast and reliable and phone , well , i 'll never buy or recommend an hp to anyone !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were sol there to , so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O
only thing i would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
finally decided to try this player because there were too many choices of which pc 's to buy and everyone who had a player said " buy this player " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not enough time for me to give it 5 stars !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen is n't huge , but that does n't matter when i output media to the 50 inch lcd tv .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also does not have bluetooth .####O O O O O B-ASP O
it is extremely portable and easily connects to wifi at the library and elsewhere .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
it is held in place magnetically .####O O O O O O O
i think it was seventy nine plus tax .####O O O O O O O O O
i am loving the fast performance also .####O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O
it is super fast and has outstanding graphics .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O

good for every day computing and web browsing .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i 've always used pc 's for work home and this is my first experience with this camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe the camera controls improvement were not the product they want to offer .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
my only gripe would be the need to add more controls .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this camera is a great price and has a sleek look .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
avoid this model .####O O O O
i do n't have that additional money right now , and therefore would n't had purchased it at this time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

without a doubt , the * design * of this dvd player fantastic .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
my g3 almost 2 yrs old and i have never had any problems with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this just keeps having it 's hard drive replaced !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
bottom line , if you can afford it , get this player !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate to say this , but if i could take this back to the shop and get my money back , then i would .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
either way , the remote is unsatisfactory .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it can not save the correct date and time i set .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would totally recommend any other player over this pile of garbage .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i am first time mac buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the ipod offers .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O

put a ssd and use a 21 " led screen , this set up is silky smooth !####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
the g3 rarely requires a hard reboot .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i can ' t believe how quiet the hard drive is and how quick this thing boots up .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i tried giving it 0 stars but i had to choose at least one , but imo no stars####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it !####O B-OP O O
speaking of the browser , it too has problems .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
i have nothing to regret from this new product .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
my wireless system would not recognize eax and i could n't get online to find out why .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
what 's really great about this product is you may have a family member who is computer illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on the player without any real supervision .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did not like my g3 .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O
i can do pretty much 75 % of what i do on my desktop on my kitchen table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a bad experience but i played down its importance .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i saw this one , and i have the most difficult time trying to use them , they 've made great dust collectors , i hate putting this player down####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
i know that everyone thinks the phones are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial expense you 'll find that they 're worth every penny ( besides , there 's always the financing plan that best buy offers ) .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this phone was awful , i would never recomend it to another person .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
this dvd player is a fantastic player .####O O O O O B-OP O O
i also made a recovery usb stick .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
they had to replace the speaker in april####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
comes with imovie ;####O O B-ASP O
set up was a breeze .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
but i am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
return it .####O O O
i took the computer back in yet again except this time they kept it to send into their geek squad headquarters .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it feels cheap , the flash is not very sensitive .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
needless to say i told them no and have a nice day and hung up !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they definitely have a superior product !####O O O O B-OP O O
i would like to use a different operating system altogether .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
it caught a virus that completely wiped out my hard drive in a matter of hours .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
they are not .####O O O O
i am not happy at all with the product i purchased .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i 'd recommend this phone to anyone !####O O B-OP O O O O O
but other than that i am blown away by all the features this laptop offers .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O
my real problem with it ? the statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it 's a lie .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's the mid 2012 version .####O O O O O O O
the dv4 boasted a faster playback , more memory , and a bigger hard drive than my old computer , plus a better quality web cam , nicer screen , and many other features .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i purchased my first mac and am glad i did .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
whenever tried to turn it on , it would restart as soon as the bios launched windows ( or winblows , as i like to call it ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it may take a little getting used to but you do n't have to worry about viruses or other headaches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought it during the recent comex it show .####O O O O O O O O O O
my dad has one of the very first toshibas ever made , yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
even though it is running snow leopard , 2 .4 ghz c2d is a bit of an antiquated cpu and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running nomad software such as word or excel .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i had my iworks , itunes , email , ms office , network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
the software is amazing .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
good in every aspect .####B-OP O O O O
the screen is nice and the images comes very clear , the remote and the fit just feels right .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the battery was completely dead , in fact it had grown about a quarter inch thick lump on the underside .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other thoughts : received replacement 16 days later .####O O O O O O O O O
no installation disk ( dvd ) is included .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O
i am paying apple to kill my self and my wallet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are so realistic i am just speechless .####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
searched it on amazon and on bestbuy .####O O O O O O O O
i think that was a great decision to buy####O O O O O B-OP O O O
it has a overheating issue - nearly to the point of being dangerous .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
i went right out and purchased another player .####O O O O O O O O O
i was very worried about making the two compatible - but literally , it was so simple i was almost worried that i was doing something wrong .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zenxtra am using is easier to use than most i have tried .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
apple " help " is a mixed bag .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i found the phone to be : exceptionally easy to set up####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP
i 'm new - just switched from years of pc frustration .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought them for my college age grandchildren and these macs are totally reliable and support their class work 100 % of the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
yes , i have it on the highest available setting .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i was given this player as a birthday present and could n't be happier with it 3 years later .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
that 's a huge difference .####O O O O O O
i have now had it for 1 .5 months and love it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
apple did a great job .####O O O B-OP O O
easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i love the form factor .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
its not just slow on the internet , its slow in general .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O
i 'm going back to pc .####O O O O O O O
i my wife is also now the proud owner of a g3 as well !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i still have that stupid bluetooth player to !####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
its everything mac offers .####O O O O O
a second problem involves the battery which is advertised as having a storage life of 11 hours but when fully charged shows only 7 hours of service .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the lesson learned here is : it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand , since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible , as fast as they can , and in this day and age , the customer no longer is right all the times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since the machine 's slim profile is critical to me , that was a problem .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i loved it .####O B-OP O O
the graphics on this computer are also stellar - very clear and vivid .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-OP O
runs like a champ.....####B-ASP O O O
i love to use it it is easy and light .####O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
the thunderbolt port is awesome !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
but sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i had finally reached my limit and broke down .####O O O O O O O O O O
we figure that after everything his pc actually ended up costing $ 350 more than my original player .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
this player is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O
would pay more for it if i had too !####O O O O O O O O O O
not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
the zenxtra very sturdy and versatile .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i recently purchased the phone and absolutely love it !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use .####O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
i would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
its also fun to use !####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i love the glass touchpad .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
apple no longer includes idvd with the computer and furthermore , apple does n't even offer it anymore !####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
such as pages , numbers , and so on .####O O O O O O O O O O
great deal on an amazing lap top !####B-OP O O O B-OP O O O
still pretty pricey , but i 've been putting off money for a while as a little macbook fund , and finally got to use it .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in fact , somehow ( and i never opened it up ) some specks of dust or something got inside the screen and are now there permanently , behind the front of the screen , in the way of the display .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O
i have owned at least 4 to 5 phones and computers - but this is by far the most superior machine i have ever owned .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i have had it 9 months and it is already a $ 250 loss .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with awesome graphics and assuring security , it 's perfect !####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O
cons : price is a bit ridiculous , kinda heavy .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
logic board utterly fried , cried , and laid down and died .####B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
and i babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
would highly recommend this dvd player though .####O O B-OP O O O O O
i get a ton of compliments on its size , and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus , i can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you 're restricted to the width of your body for computing room .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
his language was so bad i swore i was taking the turing test , and it was failing .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i returned it to best buy on the ninteenth of april .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this camera sucks####O O B-OP
the ac power port becomes loose over time####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O
which is what i did , check out my acer 5517 !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
words can not express how much i love my new player .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
but if you ca n't make your product last more than a year , you will not get my business again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a lifelong windows user , i was extremely pleased to make the change to apex .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i sent it back and found this time that the battery was faulty , so i got the zen and some other fixes they found .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , i had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my pc , but took the apple to the conference .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in fact i still use many legacy programs ( appleworks , mp3 player , quicken , photoshop etc ) !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
sure hope best buy will replace it asap .####O O O O O O O O O
some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software , but there is no guarantee .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
this player looks great on the surface : 17 " inch screen , good price-point , nice appearance , boots up quickly , runs fast etc .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O
only good thing is the graphics quality .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the new zen 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing .####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
out of all the phones i have owned , this is by far the best !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i absolutely love this camera !####O O B-OP O O O
now , the next issue i had freaked me out .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i told them that i just received my brand new macbook but i was having issues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
my zenxtra is no exception .####O O O O O O
very powerful especially for the money .####O B-OP O O O O O
anyway , ipod has really been big on downloading anything so i was n't too worried about getting a virus , plus i thought i was protected by norton .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this phone running .####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
since i have always used apple products , the choice of the zen was obvious .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've almost have bought every generation of macminis since 2005 , and this one has n't let me down .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is also fast as can be... you get what you pay for... well worth the investment####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
heck , i like all digital computers , but they 're all way too pricey for the kind of economy the u .s . is going through .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally pulled the trigger and i am blown away by how much more i enjoy my computer tasks using the zen!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it would n't fit in most 17-inch bags .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
this dvd player is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
great laptop for school , easy to use for beginners in the household .####B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
then , within 5 months , the charger crapped out on me .####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O
winters is on it 's way and i imagine it will be cozy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
which i still use and have hooked up to my tv .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the port is secured to playback so when this happens you can ' t see the plug at all , it 's just gone .####O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
we were pc users .####O O O O O
what a waste .####O O B-OP O
for some odd reasons the computer does n't recognize the operation system .####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
in summary , take your money elsewhere .####O O O O O O O O
i am forever changed and will no longer buy a windows based machine for personal use .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
images are crisp and clean .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
the majority of the reviews seem to be for the 13 .3 zen model # md101ll/a .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i spent months looking for a good mp3 player for me and i finally found it !####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
tech support would not fix the problem unless i bought your plan for $ 150 plus .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i saw walmart had the same computer for about $ 650 but still knowing what i know now , i would not buy it at that price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary product key .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
bottom line , i doubt you 'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i have no idea how to burn cd 's or to use the web cam , just for starters .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
you just lose a customer .####O O O O O O
two of the times was in one month .####O O O O O O O O O
i took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of ipod .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
they are closed at 9 pm eastern .####O O O O O O O O
at least those computers did n't just die on me like this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this thing is a lemon .####O O O O O O
they replaced it and so far so good .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
if you get a lemon ( i have two thirds of my zen ) , you have to send it in for repairs several times before they will replace it , even if they have numerous problems with the same version of their computers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life was shorter than expected .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
i can guarantee this will be the last dvd player i will ever purchase !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen is nice , side view angles are pretty good .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
i am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when i got back in town .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't have stupid pop up windows ( even when i have pop ups blocked ) , i do have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download , and best of all i can run all the web programming software i need to use all at once without slowing me down .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not recommend this company or their products!!!!####O O O B-OP O O O O O
when the buyer returned it wal mart just boxed it , taped it shut resold it as new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we carry the netbook around here and there , hence it 's kinda of irritating when the lcd just " slide " downwards .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
this is the first time for me to use a player and i 'm really happy with the move .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
well , they do n't care a bunch .####O O O O O O O O O
but until now , no complains at all .####O O O O O O O O O
it is in the best condition and has a really high quality .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
games being the main issue .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
a tip for people looking into this computer : do not buy it save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i can throw anything at it ( and i do ) , pictures , video editing , schoolwork .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm honestly afraid that it will burn me , it 's that hot !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and i have never had any issues with it freezing .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if that is the case for you , i would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate it .####O B-OP O O
i got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime i touched the lid , ( mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed ) but i suffered thru it and would constantly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
it 's absolutely wonderful and worth the price !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
it works really well .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
all in all great item highly recommend it .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O
out of the box i noticed how small it was and was exactly what i was looking for .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it has spent more time in repair shops than i can possibly recount here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anyway n't close the 2nd hdd bay since there are brackets you have to break off ( even then , it still does n't shut ) that could be a major flaw for the dual hdd user .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought my first digital camera after seeing the product demonstrated .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
very disappointed becase i have had toshibas for years , and never a issue .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen shows great colors .####O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i am not one to throw things like this around but it is an ipod so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little , while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the computer blinks it shuts off at will .####O O O O O O O O O
actually , i had noticed the one on the sales floor also did n't have sound !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i understand i should call apple tech support about any variables ( which is my purpose of writing this con ) as variables could be a bigger future problem .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got this at an amazing price from amazon and it arrived just in time .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the zenxtra net book operates very well .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i hate it !####O B-OP O O
buying this dvd player would allow me to make the transition .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it works fine , and all the software seems to run pretty well .####O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O

i 'm so glad i purchased a player and not another pc!!!####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
loaded with bloatware .####O O B-ASP O
while many people brag about this being " intuitive " , it does take a little time to adjust to coming from this phone , but once i got the hang of it , i do n't want to go back .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my husband purchased this player at the same time for about $ 300 less ( he got a pc ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this player does n't do that well with certain games it can ' t play some and it becomes too hot while playing games .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
another issue i have with it is the battery .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O
i 'm overall pleased with the interface and the portability of this product .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
stop living in the stone age and buy a player , you will not be sorry at all!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
because it is a defective product .####O O O O B-OP O O
i had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity , because it is very sensitive .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
no machine has come remotely close to causing as many problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has all the expected features and more + plus a wide screen and more than roomy flash .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
deal of the year .####O O O O O
the only problem is a lack of screen resolutions !####O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the display is incredibly bright , much brighter than my powerbook and very crisp .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O

the one thing that apple does right is computers .####O O O O O O O O O O
she brought out 2 other identical netbooks and still insist that " it is like that one " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i only used it to browse the internet and and i dont know how many times it has spontaneously shut down and it is just a blank screen now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
this was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it freezes , and it always shows that there is an error , so i have to restart it a few times every time i use it .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and i would recommend this to anyone looking for a digital camera .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
definitely worth spending the money on it .####O B-OP O O O O O O
usb3 peripherals are noticably less expensive than the thunderbolt ones .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O O
has a 5-6 hour battery life .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i had in the past a zenxtra they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
the zen , point and shoot digital camera and a hdmi cable is all i need to get some real work done .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the system it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the people there just changed for me on the spot and i got a new arm piece and they did n't even request for a receipt .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
small screen somewhat limiting but great for travel .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O
i paid for this dvd player , but was sent a used one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if the number of patrons in the zen store are any indication , ipod and other pc manufacturers need to take note .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the price is great for this model , i only plan on using it for media in the entertainment room .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there is nothing better .####O O O B-OP O
i needed a new computer for graduate school ( had never owned this player before ) , and the only reason i did n't purchase this player was because my school 's website strongly recommended students purchase pcs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i try to use it today and can ' t logon .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zen one computer that i bought is 17 inch screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it , but i like the big screen on it .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O
charger seems large for this class of computer .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
after looking at all the pros and cons , i decided on the zenxtra .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
might not make the avid gamer happy but i do n't really think that is what this player is designed for .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great pick for portability and affordability .####B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the zenxtra is portable , durable , and very capable .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
i 'm a professional consultant , and a client needed work on her machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

awesome form factor , great battery life , wonderful ux .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i 've only had it one day , but i really do love it and i 'm happy it was economical and i'm finally able to own this player !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
theres a built-in camera with special effects - for video and photography .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
clear picture on it and everything .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
i have had to send in my laptop three times to get it fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great product .####B-OP O O
this player has left me with a horrible taste in my mouth for mp3 brand products .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
very fast for my needs .####O B-OP O O O O
overall a nice computer .####O O B-OP O O
this player advertised as a 15 " but the casing looks like that of a 17 " .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
great wifi too .####B-OP B-ASP O O
it makes sorting out all those photos on my digital camera a breeze , and organizing them by place , time taken , or uploading them to an online print shop , or upload them to flickr or facebook etc , is not hard at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
it 's light and easy to transport .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
seriously considering a larger player to replace the dell####O O O O O O O O O
so then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back , but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened , and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair ( the price of the ipod ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
not to mention , the battery life is absolutely amazing .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
i am addicted to photo booth !####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
comfortable to use light easy to transport .####B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O
ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about my mac .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i returned the computer to hp and they kept it for 3 months .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the g3 shipped to their repair depot on june 24 and returned on july 2 seems like a short turn around time except the g2 not repaired when it was returned .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i should have realized that trouble was brewing .####O O O O O O O O O
all i will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hunk of crap vaio .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
i have had a total of 5 different phones from many different manufactures .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they gave me a hard time yet again , but their was a malfunction in the battery itself , it did n't die .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
if you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get this player !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is known as safari , and if you are doing any website work , you should know that many hosting companies do not support it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
these new problems were the final straws ;####O O O O O O O O
it is so great , i can hardly ever take my hands off it !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this player in order to replace my old zenxtra .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
despite the inconvenient weight , i opted for the 12 cell battery .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
when this happened i would have to completely power off my computer and restart it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
about 2 months ago i bought the 2011 macbook player , which was an upgrade from my 2010 zenxtra .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this system came loaded with video encoding settings .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
this player has set me up with free recovery discs , when they are available since i asked .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it has had some problems .####O O O O B-OP O
again this is just my personal honest opinion .####O O O O O O O O O
i have had this phone for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
honestly , this is absolutely wonderful .####O O O O O B-OP O
not easy to carry .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
i just took the broken cords into the nomad store and they gave me new ones .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i dislike is the touchpad , alot of the times its unresponsive and does things i dont want it too , i would recommend using a remote with it .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O
with a healthy pessimism , i took the machine home and tried to find a flaw .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am so happy to have purchased this player .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
it easily fits into most computer bags but does n't weigh down a backpack or satchel when being carried with spirals and/or textbooks .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the guy then said that if i insist on having the hinge tightened , they can do it for me but i have to accept the condition after the " repair " .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , i went back .####O O O O O O
i just love this camera , i just wish it were all silver or they had all black .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
high price tag , however .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
i have had no luck with staples or phones to resolve this problem .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
the price and features more than met my needs .####O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O
bought notebook 07/2009 .####O O O O

this player looked brand new and was shipped very quickly .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty would transfer to the new computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
my player with stop button crashed and i did not want stop button .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
finally set the unit back to apex after a month of hell .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i believe this is because i was more active than the average user , meaning i average about three " tabs " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

very fast and efficient !####O B-OP O B-OP O
and it has blue screen crashed on me twice .####O O O O O O O O O O
not with apple .####O O O O
then the hard drive failed ;####O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
it is fast and i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other problems .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
its worth every penny .####O B-OP O O O
also , the battery does not last very long at all .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O
it has served my needs quite nicely for the most part .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
just be careful ; you always have to give up some good stuff for others .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
can never go wrong with apple products .####O O O O O O O O
i thought the white phones computers looked dirty too quickly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
seems a much more economical way to get into apple than their other computers .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
you wo n't have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient camera program that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a nice little gadget .####O O O B-OP O O O

i was originally concerned that i could n't view work i had done in songs on my mac because of the pc formatting , but i was even more thrilled to learn of programs like ilife and iwork that allow you to convert your pc documents into readable files on macs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mine came at $ 1 ,700 w/o a dvd burner ( ! ) .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
this system is not worth the money or trouble trying to get it fix .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i was told by many that it was a great computer , but we got one of these , and it worked great for one year , and as soon as the warrenty was up , then it got really bad .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
i looked around and based off my price / features comparison from a brand i trusted i landed here .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
no temporary replacement , they are out of replacements because " many computers had problems with the nvidia chipset " - inquired status of repair .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
came fully loaded - good .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
from the moment i opened the box to the present it has been a great joy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now that i have it i see that i really needed this for much more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the criticism has waned , and now i 'd be the first to recommend an air for truly portable computing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i went to my local best buy looking for this dvd player since mine broke .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then after paying for it to be examined i was told it was same problem cited on website but i 'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
but the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24/7 .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i am having a friend look at it , but will probably return it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is what they told me : it heats up , and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops , and simply categorize them as portables .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if i have a problem with any of my apple items i make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
emachines says they 're waiting for a part and refuses to replace entire unit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

while the computer seems to be set up in a common sense way rather than in geek-speak , there are certain quirks that can drive you crazy trying to deal with the pc world .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i bought this one for my 11 year old and the zen air for my 9 year old .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got it for christmas , and i was so excited to set it up !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O

toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the resolution is even higher than any other player on the market .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the zen pro has been a huge disappointment .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
mom , dad , brother , sister , you name it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
seriously why have n't they just replaced it by now .####O O O O O O O O O O O
lots of extra space but the player is ridiculously small .####B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i bought this dvd player for traveling , and it 's great - light , functional , and meets my needs .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
right out of the box , this little dvd player did everything i asked of it , including streaming the everyday video you 're bound to encounter checking mail and websites ( my biggest complaint previously ) .####O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i bought this dvd player a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

now the machine wo n't connect and toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in may but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now i 'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since i bought the zen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

also , i have had a lot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
probably the worst decision we ever made !####O O B-OP O O O O O
it does n't have a lot of frills , but i did n't need any , and being able to buy what i needed , and not more than i needed was very important .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* 3 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - visited machouse amsterdam .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i called toshiba and they want me to be without my g3 about two weeks while they look at the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer , they paid postage and whatnot , but when i got my computer back it still was n't running right , and now my cd drive was n' reading anything !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
so you do n't get frustrated the first few weeks .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
honestly , i am surprised no one else has mentioned returning theirs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
product support very poor as each phone call costs me long distan####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O

the screen is framed by half - to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary , reduces the screen size and increases the bulk .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O
do not buy you will be disappointed .####O O O O O O B-OP O

the extended warranty for the $ 4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the notebook would not turn back on again .####O O O O O O O O O
and plenty of storage with 250 gb ( though i will upgrade this and the manual . . )####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
that 's how frustrating it was .####O O O B-OP O O O
i have n't used the product long enough to write a detailed technical review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
will not every buy another lou####O O O O O O
the 4 manual options are nice , but the two on the side only work now and then .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is also relatively good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
with all the goodies inside this machine , it is a value .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my daughter uses it for games , email , facebook , pictures and music .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the perfect notebook...####O B-OP O
all my devises [UNK] talk [UNK] to each other .####O O O O O O O O O O
it certainly does , but you rarely hear any of your friends with mac 's complain about anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this notebook and only had it for 3 months if it is overload with updates the player 's manual .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
theres always something wrong with it , wether it be some phone you can ' t track down , or it overheats , sometimes even catches on fire , you just can ' n ' t use it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
again , i sent it off to t-mobile , by this time they were paying for me to send it to them and everything , but it was still inconvenient because of my classes and my communication with my fiance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the display is beyond horrible .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O

i 've had the zenxtra 15 for about three weeks , and it really is a great computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O

even doing so , the hinge may just be slightly tightened only .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i just bought the zenxtra the 13 " model , and i can ' t believe apple keeps making the same mistake with regard to auto settings .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

when my zen gave up only after 2-1/2 years , i decided to buy this dvd player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i think i might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i 'd pop them off to see what the problem was , well guess what ? the darn thing would n't go back on .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, which apple does n't offer , is why i bought this dvd player at best buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there is hardly any memory on the computer 's hard drive .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

this player was so challenging to carry and handle .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
creative mediasource makes this computer almost unusable for online service .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
after paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is frustrating that you can not get help after hours .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
as a die-hard windows enthusiast , i shunned the idea of this player until this point .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i waited another month for approval and for them to " build " me an ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it all just makes sense .####O O O O O O
very nice unibody construction .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
this version of the zen runs on a third-generation cpu ( " ivy bridge " ) , not the latest fourth-generation haswell cpu the 2013 version has .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches , dents or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of damage could happen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was important that it was powerful enough to do all of the tasks he needed on the internet , word processing , graphic design and play .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O

browsing , also , was no problem for me when i used itunes ( which usually slows down my pc ) .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
this is by far the best , most reliable computer i could find .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O

the investment of a zenxtra came at a price , but totally worth it for a good piece of mind .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O

people know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was starting to boil .####O O O O O O
i just love this camera !####O O B-OP O O O
it is better than my old zenxtra .####O O B-OP O O O O O
i have full control at all times of what is going on - there is no control + alt + delete business anymore .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we have n't had any problems with it at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i love its solid build , light weight and excellent battery life ( for now ) .####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they update the next version on the zen book the quality of it will be better .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
i can ' t wait until i go on vacation and take it with me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
pc users use the powerpoint program for slide-show presentation and mac users utilize keynote .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it 's a good fix , in my opinion .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i already have a zen bought last year that 's standard size .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
at first , the computer seemed a great deal -- seemingly high-end specs for a low , low price .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
i blame the built-in camera .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O
i had always used pcs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
but i 'm still learning so i can ' t rate it yet for everything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
so ? how can you solve it ? c'mon , i just bought the netbook 2 weeks ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they also have a longer service life than other computers ( i have several friends who still use the older apple powerbooks ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it could n't have been a better decision .####O O O O O O O O O
im glad that it has such great features in it .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
typically , when i purchase a zen i always end up using an i/p button for convenience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
buy this if you like being tortured , teased , frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old player .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very annoying .####O B-OP O
battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i will never purchase a player again ever .####O O O O O O O O O
it is really thick around the battery .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
so in late march , early april 2009 i was without it again for a couple weeks while i had online courses i had to complete and my fiance was in afghanistan and web conferencing was the best communication method we had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
this player has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks , and i would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
summary : after doing some investigation on the web , i have found that the zen nb205s are not chronically not booting .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no waiting to have my claim reviewed by someone in another state ( or more often , another country ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i first purchased this zen model " 1764 " on april 6 , 201####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also liked the glass screen .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the new os is great on this dvd player !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
when i called sony the customer service was great .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
graphics are clean and sharp , internet interfaces are seamless .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
( if you ever see the spinning beachball come up when you think it should n't , check the " activity monitor " app to see if the disk throughput has temporarily dropped to zero .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the unibody construction is solid , sleek and beautiful .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O
all the programs are easy and straight forward on the zenxtra , it is clean and organized , which i always strive to be myself .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
but to be honest , the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think i ll buy this player next time .####O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
battery is lasting about 6 hours as i am surfing the web on sundays while checking football scores and watching funny youtube videos .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the id3 tag placement is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
now i have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the player !####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
i burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table , so i can place it there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all for such a great price .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i babyed the heck out of it and i still do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
that was my first apple product and since then i have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs i have bought .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
nice packing .####B-OP B-ASP O
setting would change for some reason , the screen size would change on it 's own , like the pixel sizes and whatnot .####B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
then on top of it all their customer service center is in the middle east .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
thanks for the fast shipment and great price .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the image is great , and the sound is excellent .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
summary : dont buy hp .####O O O O O O
the power prod touch plug-in is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
if you have the money i suggest going for the i7 .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i dislike the weight and size , cubersome .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O
also is portable and reliable .####O O B-OP O B-OP O
before i begin , i will say that i am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this player - i am an ipod fanboy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
only a few days after i received the computer back , the screen froze again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O
and the best part is that it even comes with a free printer ( when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course ) !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
microsoft word was not on it and i had to buy it seperately .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was at my door in less than 24 hours .####O O O O O O O O O O O
my phone now has no battery .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
is this partially due to the fact that it is running notmad software ?####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
my sister has the same player as me and she is in a band and uses garageband to record and edit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
quality display i love this , , it 's the only computer/printer we will buy .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
and not to mention after using it for a few months or so , the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you can ' t leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
love this camera wonderful price for what you get !####B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
if you want more information on this phone i suggest going to apple .com and heading towards the zen page for more information of the applications .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it is the worst laptop ever####O O O B-OP O O
i will never again buy another mp3 player , not will i buy gateway , or emachine as they are all from the same company .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate , i chose the zen over the white zen .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
so of course this one came through with the awesomeness !####O O O O O O O O O O O
it really is very light compared to other computers .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
unfortunately , apple 's quality has continued to slide .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i would recommend this phone phone to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i believe that the quality of this camera is worth the price .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
great product , very easy to use and great graphics .####B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i am sorry that i purchased this player .####O O O O O O O O O
reason why ? it 's because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that player , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10-20 % , unlike pc laptops which drop more than 80 % .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
super light , super sexy and everything just works .####O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
you will love this dvd player if you choose to buy it .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i tell everyone i see out looking to get this or another mp3 player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but this dvd player is the best !####O O O O O O B-OP O
they did n't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , hdd secures inside using rails , and there is only one set on the main hard drive .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i would never go back any more , i love this player so much and i would recommend it to everyone .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i was a little worry at first because i do n't have a lot of experience with os .x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
- they lost my player for a month####O O O O O O O O
( beware , their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a player is .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this lap top and the charge time dose n't last as long as they say it will more like 2 hours####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
so , the hard disk capacity really does n't matter to me .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
i bought this player about a month ago to replace my compaq player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is easily portable and i take it everywhere i go and might require internet access .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
more times that not the screen pops up saying i have a bad internet connection , or the page can ' t be displayed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
osx mountain lion soon to upgrade to mavericks .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
i love the easy to see screen , and it works well for work , personal or just play .####O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O
so i 'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all the above aside this machine rocks !####O O O O O O B-OP O
it 's fast , light , and simple to use .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
great os , fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the sound tab and adding the thunderbolt port .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
you may just lose 1 customer for now .####O O O O O O O O O
- complied to their protocol , called number , made " case " , got an email address to send complaint .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
it 's just a great toy to have around .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
as a computer science student in college , i find that the portability , longevity , and ease of use of this player make me ( shockingly ) want to do homework more ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased an apex right after my high school graduation .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's even easy to hook up to other wireless networks .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
so this was great for me .####O O O B-OP O O O
love that it does n't take up space like a regular computer .####B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
here we are another year later and the g3 doing the same thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and , if you are going to deal with apex be careful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was really happy because it is a much better price on amazon .com than it was in the ipod store .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i am very happy !####O O O B-OP O
do i like the computer ? well , other than not getting phones , i guess it is ok .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
i bought this player the moment unibody product came to the market .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while we struggle with all the crashes and viruses , the kids computers stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for business !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
after using it for over a month , an issue started to surface .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm returning mine####O O O O
i love this product because it is toshiba and its 15 .6 " .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
but when i received my replacement , i made both recovery dvds ( 4 ) , and a driver/application dvd .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
info : windows failed to load because the kernal is missing , or corrupt .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
also , the extended warranty was a problem .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
they click .####O O O
built-in apps are purely amazing .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
this player was very easy to set up .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is a great value for the money .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
the cool thing about this is anyone can use it .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i 'm going to buy a logitech c270 .####O O O O O O O O O
if yo like practicality this is the player for you .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
i can ' t even install one of the 3 printers i have in my house so i am unable to print .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site , then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the minute you fire it up it 's all good , very easy user interface .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i had to return it because it would n't even start .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
but , for the cost this is a winner .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
minis make sense for a lot of people .####O O O O O O O O O
it is robust , with a friendly use as all apple products .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
another two weeks later and it was back in my possession .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
would buy 100 more of these if i could .####O O O O O O O O O O
i love it so much .####O B-OP O O O O
the screen resolution was exactly what i was looking for .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
i would recommend to any one looking for a first class computer !####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
it 's solid .####O O B-OP O
i look forward to years of use , it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i bought this player because of the performance to price ratio .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
i reinstalled windows through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
i contacted acer and they are giving me free recovery dvds , so do n't go and pay for them , just ask for them and they should give them to you .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen almost looked like a barcode when it froze .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
the computer could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never go back to this player again !####O O O O O O O O O O
this little netbook is helping me get work done !####O O O O O O O O O O
i got this phone on black friday .####O O O O O O O O
asked the customer service rep .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i did think it had a remote because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i purchased .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i paid about the same for my zenxtra as i did for the compaq a few years back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that i have , is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can see why the have soooo much money .####O O O O O O O O O O
seems to me that 's the best way to get apple 's attention .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can ' t imagine my life without it anymore !####O O O O O O O O O O O
i do everything on this phone - check email , facebook , shop , check blogs , write papers , listen to music , and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i play a lot of casual games online , and the touchpad is very responsive .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
what a mistake !####O O O O
moving from the ipod to the player has never been easier , and i 'm glad that i did it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i saved for this phone for 3 months and i can tell you personally it was worth the wait .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
never any doubt i would get a zen , just was n't sure which one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
he ca n't stand it .####O O O O O O
1 ) payed $ 2200 for a " premium " laptop####O O O O O O O O O O O
the next time i had an issue my lightscribe would n't work .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about this camera .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
very light and easily maneuverable .####O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O
the internet speed is spectacular .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
this is the third apex dvd player in our family .####O O O O O O O O O O O
one of the primary reasons why i purchased an ipad was to store photographs so that i could show to my customers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am a freelance graphic artist .####O O O O O O O
it was getting old and i needed a new school computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
with the upgraded memory , the zen never has an issue running many many applications at once !####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
the only pro to this phone is it was under $ 600 !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
let me tell you , this machine is great .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i opted for the squaretrade 3-year computer accidental protection warranty ( $ 1500-2000 ) which also support " accidents " like drops and spills that are not covered by applecare .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this is what i call a good after sales service .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i love it - never had a computer i was so impressed with - and i 've had a lot of phones and desktops - this one is far and above the best one i ever had before .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O
his was worth $ 36 .####O O O O O O
and toshiba is a quality supplier .####O O O O O O O
it is more than enough computer to keep up with the needs of a high school student .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
from the build quality to the performance , everything about it has been sub-par from what i would have expected from this player####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
graphics are much improved .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
i picked it out because it was inexpensive ( $ 400 ) and i thought it would be a good , easy to use first player .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
and then , a guy came out to serve me instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
they sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
still , this camera is perfect for all day use at school and work .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
its not bad just very very annoying .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
i had my pc for 3 years and going to a zenxtra is like i leaped through time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but while this is one big advantage ( as you may know from the company s recent commercials ) there are other things to consider before going with this player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to pay $ 100 for a universal charger for this cheap $ 300 player .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
but enough about that , i am able to convert for life .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , the player i purchased was also a point and shoot player and again , i have to say i hated it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it is a great computer for that and i have to say i 'm happy i switched .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
very very highly recommended .####O O O B-OP O
oh , it is such a great piece of equipment .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
runs good and does the job , ca n't complain about that !####B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
this process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
( you may be reading one now !####O O O O O O O O
finally , the biggest problem has been tech support .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
no cd rom in the new version there 's no way i 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
trashed it when i spilled a latte on it while writing at a cafe .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've installed to it additional ssd and 3x flash .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never buy another hp computer .####O O O O O O O O
the manufacturer 's warranty only covers replacement/repair of parts .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
having had experience with a toshiba laptop , i was disappointed to find that the toshik nb305 phone has major problems .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
some features are n't friendly ( volume wheel , sound quality , etc .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
acer wo n't replace this player .####O O O O O O O
i recommend this dvd player if you want the best laptop on the market .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
although i opted for the lowest end zenxtra , this thing holds its own .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unable to scroll wheel this brand new player .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
but , at the same time they ( the company ) would not and could not do anything about my problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i waited and waited and no phone .####O O O O O O O O
by week two , my phone had overheated and was completely dead even though i did not use it too much .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
they have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and i 'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
satisfy what i paid for it .####B-OP O O O O O O
love it so far .####B-OP O O O O
it had a seventeen inch screen which i wanted , but i did n't realize at the time it would be such a monster !####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also got the added bonus of a 30 " hd monitor , which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh !####O O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
purchased as a gift for a friend .####O O O O O O O O

? i am only interested in the 15 .4 mcbook player model # md103ll/a####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was going to buy today and noticed it went back up to $ 344 .99 ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the g3 is beautiful has many wonderful capabilities .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
after trying to get some help he disconnected on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in ( mousing over the battery icon would read , for example , " 74 % , plugged in , not charging " ) , requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
a tip for people looking into this player : do not buy it save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you pay for what you get for .####O O O O O O O O
this player is much more efficient than a pc so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did n't because it was already over 2 ,400 dollars !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
after fumbling around with the os i started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100 % that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets , and rather quickly too .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
it runs perfectly .####O B-ASP B-OP O
shipped very quickly and safely .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
i bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her , it 's very lightweight , and the response for the computing she 's doing ( internet focused activity : mail , research , etc . ) is excellent ;####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
and at one point , they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when i upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the ipod ( i bought the memory stick they recomended ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
best money i ever spent .####B-OP O O O O O
i was said it 's video card .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i loaded creative labs via bootcamp and it works flawlessly !####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
10/10 five stars would recommend .####O B-OP I-OP O B-OP O
this is my second macbook .####O O O O O O
i have a lapdesk which i can use , but i can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in my opinion it was not as user friendly as i expected either .####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
i now own another hewlett packard .####O O O O O O O
with what i paid for this player it should have had everything on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it looks and feels solid , with a flawless finish .####O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i 'll stick to toshiba .####O O O O O O
he gave me this pc about 3 years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is starting off good .####O O O O B-OP O
this was my first apex purchase ever .####O O O O O O O O
i 've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it works perfectly .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
toshiba is a great brand , even though i have n't had it for a long time , i am very happy with it !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
finally , i purchased a zenxtra .####O O O O O O O
if you ask me , for this price it should be included .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i can ' t imagine ever buying this player again !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the first time it crashed was maybe going on a year and a half of having it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when you call tech support you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its perfect , not much heavy .####O B-OP O O O B-OP O
you can ' t even get a satellite card which is why i bought to begin with .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
after doing cad work all day at work , using a higher end pc , i could n't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has good speed and plenty of hard drive space .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i bought it from hsn because it was " bundled " with extra software , but as it turns out , that software just crashes it more often.....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
has all the other features i wanted including a vga port , hdmi , ethernet and 3 usb ports .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it was loaded with notmad mediasource software -- delivered with only nomad nomad tags , and it was a * dog * .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than apple 's previous player .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
they break down just as often as pcs do , and the only reason they do n't get viruses , is because no one makes songs for them , they 're not better in any way , they are worse , try finding id3 jukebox , they do read the id3 tag .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i have n't used it for anything high tech yet , but i love it already .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
another satisfied customer .####O B-OP O O
this hardware seems to be better than the imac in that it is n't $ 1400 and smaller .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it doesnt get hot like my pc , with technology always at the tip of our fingertips anytime i forget how to do something i just google it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even with manual controls , it always turned off when updates were needed and installed .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the battery gets so hot it is scary .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O
it lasted for many years of travel , kids and abuse and if i fired it up today , it would work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do not buy it !####O O O O O
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
not too expense and has enough storage for most users and many settings .####O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
everything is so easy to use , web software is just so much simpler than microsoft software .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
it 's fast , quiet , incredibly small and affordable compared to other digital models .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
the pictures are clear as can be .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
i got this one for thanks giving offer for $ 962 :) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that 's the downside for me .####O O O O O O O
well , i bought this laptop a month or two ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this player was bad from the first day of use ---- brought it back to store for return of money .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i 've owned every " pro " model apple zen the last 8 years , this is by far the worst one i 'd ever had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
with this dvd player it comes with free security software to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
guess i 'll stay away from apex .####O O O O O O O O
the item received was exactly as identified .####O O O O O O O O
my toshiba did not have sound on everything , just certain things .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
now they are believers in the product .####O O O O O O O O
the ease of set up was terrific .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
yet , canon wo n't do anything about the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O
if it 's not shipped on the next business day , called on a friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
thank you for your great product !####O O O O B-OP O O
its still going .####O O O O
well i got this computer from best buy and i have had nothing but problems i bought the computer with a virus.....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
back she goes !####O O O O
i took it back to best buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the worst dvd player ever did to me was freeze up .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
runs very smoothly .####B-ASP O B-OP O
power supply went bad after 2 weeks --####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
great price free shipping what else can i ask for!!####B-OP B-ASP B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
in short , you could say your mac could become your best friend ( no intention of replacing rover your dog ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
using this machine is like a mild form of torture .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i am really heartbroken to have to post a terrible review .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the battery life has not decreased since i bought it , so i 'm thrilled with that .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i shopped around before buying .####O O O O O O
i do n't understand why only fm radio is included .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the latest and mightiest zenxtra 17-inch was bought by my university on the 30th of june 2009 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is basically the best camera camera camera have ever had or used .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
it is very durable , i am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O
it had some kind of pre installed software update that completely shut the computer down when you clicked it .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i plan on using this dvd player for a long time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't have any technical pearls to share .####O O O O O O O O O O
but with this player , the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
its a good laptop for its value .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
but the arm velcro is torn after one use .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
yeah , it 's super expensive .####O O O O O B-OP O
it was always getting froze up .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O
love it i 've always been an ipod fan boy , but never had the money to buy ipod , only ipads andiphones , and this is my first mac , blew me away completely .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
system is running great .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ok , this is probably the best digital series ever devised by apple .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
so a couple of years later , i was a dumb college girl and had to have the wireless internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they have more problems then a 1980 's computer .####O O O O O O O O O O
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
they say it could be the remote again , but anyway !####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
there is no way i will buy a lg product in the future .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the memory was gone and it was not able to be used .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
very satisfied .####O B-OP O
i know that the player is known for making motherboards , but this is the worst computer experience that i have ever had .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
web surfuring is smooth and seamless .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
an absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
this player is great !####O O O B-OP O
i bought this macbook pro from best buy under a year ago to replace my old zen air .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just a month and a half or two months ago , my vaio crashed again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
enough said .####O O O
have n't regretted it one bit .####O O O O O O O
sounds like a typewriter , but if you can get past that , this is a great player for a little money !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
after replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working ( 3 months of use ) which was frustrating .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this is my first apple camera .####O O O O O O O
we now own two of these , identical .####O O O O O O O O O
i saved about $ 100 plus tax ordering on amazon and since i have prime , it arrived overnight for just $ 3 .99 more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
best buy laughed when i told them they should replace it instead of expecting me to be without a computer again for another couple of weeks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O
i previously owned an older dell player that died after about 5 or 6 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
further , the zen has a sloppy bluetooth interface ( courtesy of the speakerphone ) and the range is poor .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
so far , a great product .####O O O O B-OP O O
apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , this dvd player is priced just right .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i 've always owned a pc and decided to try a zen to see what it 's all about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this worked just fine .####O O O B-OP O
went silently .####O O O
this is now my 3rd dvd player and i really honestly love it !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the player in the sky!!####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is excellent , the display is excellent , and downloading apps is a breeze .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all i use the old memory card which works good .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
fits all my personal needs .####B-OP O O O O O
wonderful zooming .####B-OP B-ASP O
so it was only about 2 weeks ago .####O O O O O O O O O
premium price for the os more than anything else .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
the only solution is to turn the brightness down , etc .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i feel that enough people have this phone these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far , it 's an average phone - no better , no worse than the hp i replaced .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
the second issue i had with it occured a month later and it kept overheating , even if on for less than an hour !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ultimate graduation gift .####O O O O O
i called back to ensure that received it , they had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
c'mon , lg .####O O O O
being a tech savvy , apple - product loving person , i 'm glad i finally got this dvd player !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
you will regret it if you buy any mp3 player .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
if you buy , pray you dont have major problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is the battery only last 1 .5-2 .0 hrs when not plugged in .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
that included the extra sony sonic stage software , the speakers and the subwoofer i got ( that was worth the money ) , the louz flash for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer , the extended life battery and the docking port .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
they really do have the worlds very worst repair service .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it doesnt overheat or make any loud noises .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
i wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused , because they knew it was trouble .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
after replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working ( 3 months of use ) which was frustrating .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
anyway , i used daily nice compact design .####O O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O
i wish toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the os at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
this g3 is a perfect supplementary computer to another player or player ( my wife and i have another laptop ) , or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can call apex and they want you to buy more software to fix it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i finally did it and this machine is the way to go !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , owing to these problems , i went out and got myself the zenxtra which i am using with great satisfaction at this very moment .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
it gives me the power and speed that i need to run all the programs i use to edit .####O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i would highly recommend this dvd player .####O O O B-OP O O O O
at home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24 " lcd screen , so built in screen size is not terribly important .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i wish the volume could be louder and the player didnt break after only a month .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
my friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance , picture quality , and ease of use .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
a scratch on a $ 1 ,500 dvd player unforgivable .####O O O O O O O O O O O
what 's also interesting is this survey changed my ratings the first time i submitted it in case it does n't keep what i put here are my ratings####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
much of which player ended up paying for .####O O O O O O O O O
a mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O

i brought this player last friday , and originally it worked fantastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i 'm so happy with this dvd player !####O O O B-OP O O O O O
the book is useless .####O O O B-OP O
it is made better , thicker , and all out tough !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
( for those old enough to remember , it is similar to beta versus vhs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall very impressed , thank you apple and amazon !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i took it back for a full refund .####O O O O O O O O O
i have had some excellent computer and have found i had no idea what to do with them####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could n't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
this a starter notebook .####O O O O O
in november my computer messed up entirely and would n't power on after installing a windows update , i had to have my hd flashed and lost everything on it , including my school assignments and irreplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason i was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installing it deleted my history .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not know for sure .####O O O O O O O
it also came with a built it web cam which is great because i can see an communicate with my family members back home .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
purchased a toshiba lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O
this notebook restarts every time there is a new update , so if you do n't save your files and information , everything will be lost .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
it is everything i 'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
its only crashed on me one time in the 3 months i 've had it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
taking notes , research , an online class and such and did n't want to spend too much on my first machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
will certainly use macconnection again .####O O O O O O
a couple things you should know :####O O O O O O O
love the stability of the included software and operating system .####B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
so do n't get it .####O O O O O O
its seen in movies , sitcoms , prominent important people carry and use them and they are great !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i like coming back to speakerphone but this player is lacking in speaker quality compared to my $ 400 old hp player .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it has a faster camera and more manual .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i am a wife , mom and a school teacher and a college student .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zenxtra is the premier choice for creative students .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
pay attention to the specs if you want these options .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
note , however , that any existing magsafe accessories you have will not work with the magsafe 2 connection .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
other installed features , such as certain printer software , are also most attractive .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O
they are about the same size keys .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
if this is an improvement in customer service then i would hate too see what it was before !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had nothing but problems since the day i took it out of the box !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
never had a single problem , and do n't have to worry about apex .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so buyer beware when buying toshiba####O O O O O O
this causes my wrist to scrape up against it .####O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm so disgusted that i wasted my money on this product .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O
hp said i had done the damage .####O O O O O O O O
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the 15 " zenxtra .####O B-OP O O O O O
i saw the bad reviews from people saying to buy directly from apple and i was concerned but i took my chances and am overly impressed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i have used a couple of others on the job as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i upgraded it 's zoom to 2gb , i am very happy with it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it seems to have some options that are installed but do not work like i thought they would .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my g3 is so much better looking and so thin !####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O
apparently well built and gorgeous to look at , the i5 zenxtra is a winning combination of price and performance .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
waited on getting this player , but it has been a great change .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
hp refused to give me a new one and wal mart refused to take it back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is really expensive though .####O O O B-OP O O
we purchased this as a back up computer after our more expensive player needed to be repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am going to shoot next year and i needed a cheaper , quality computer for the goals i am trying to pursue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 ) player still did not work , blue screen within a week...####O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
very happy with my 7th zenxtra !####O B-OP O O O O O
i was a little weary at purchasing another zen macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O
next , most acer apex fans are on the bottom which is right on your player .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i was given a demonstration of playlists .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
i will stack it up against phones that cost twice as much any day .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
great battery life .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it blue screened on me without any warning , running simply basic chrome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the graphics are great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
1st hand experience is very important , especially for a new customer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the device speaks about it self .####O O O O O O O
i have found a lot of online sources to help me but think that i would have learned a lot quicker if i would had taken the class .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
screen is a bit glossy , but that 's not too bad .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
be safe buy a sony .####O O O O O O
easy learning curve .####O O O O
as usual at customer service center , she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague ( i could see them ) .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
another thing i might add is the battery life is excellent .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i should have sent it back to them then .####O O O O O O O O O O
so when i had the money to buy one i bought other things instead... a 700 ipod some extra stuff with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have other computers that get strong signals that do n't drop in places that this " net " book loses its signal .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
just for a stupid cd .####O O O B-OP O O
i 'm all for saving money but dell needs to step it up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had upgraded my old zen to lion , so i kind of knew what i was getting , but had n't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
with all the programs that came with it , such as ilife and iwork , i was set from the very beginning .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
before we got this player , had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the two of us use it regularly .####O O O O O O O O
the screen gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it 's very noticeable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
i like it !####O B-OP O O
the remote control is a bit squirrely at times - sometimes too sensitive , and sometimes a bit unresponsive , but it 's usable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
the salesman talked us into this player away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP O O O
never had a problem with it !####O O O O O O O
i love my new computer !####O B-OP O O O O
incredible graphics and brilliant colors .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
for example , when my husband turns the light out while i 'm on the computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the os is great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
it is quiet and a real joy to watch work .####O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
the dell player was the first dell product that i had ever purchased .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had my computer custom built from sonystyle .com .####O O O O O O O O O O
it 's been time for the zen , and the only debate was which size of the mac laptops , and whether to spring for the retina display .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
its a dog plain and simple .####O O O O O O O
there is no hdmi receptacle , nor is there an sd card slot located anywhere on the device .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
no phone is perfect , but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i called toshiba where i gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it does n't heat up like my old player .####O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased a zenxtra and this to replace a couple of hp units that i was using .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this player does everything i need it to do for school and more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the large screen gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or tv shows on your computer instead of buying an additional tv for your dorm room .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bluetooth was not there at all , and the fingerprint reader driver would be there , but the software would hang after installation was 1/2 way done .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
besides being elegant , the macbooks are durable .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
having a mac certainly makes life easier .####O O O O O O B-OP O
if this would be your first digital purchase then i would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between phones and pc 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's applications are terrific , including the replacements for microsoft office .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
but , i would recommend this product .####O O O O B-OP O O O
i considered i may have too much on the computer , but after looking , there was plenty of space and that is not the issue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
boot-up slowed significantly after all windows updates were installed .####B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
it absolutely is more expensive than most pc laptops , but the ease of use , security , and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O
so , i 'm cooled on apex buys .####O O O O O O O O O
i purchased this player 9 months ago !####O O O O O O O O
not working = bad####O O O B-OP
also i typed faster then then thenthen letters would show and it got to be realy annoying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
my player is very heavy .####O O O O B-OP O
it doesnt work worth a damn .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O
called apex many times , they want me to pay the shipping to ship it to their repair center - i was very disappointed since it is a brand new computer !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
frustrated i hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still i think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
my first problem was with the pre-loaded norton firewall/security program .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the computer itself was fast , ran smoothly , and had no problems .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
great player for the price , works well with action pack games .####B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
everything was up and running within 15 minutes of unboxing .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's great to have a solid player in the living room .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
all i can say is i am impressed .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
i would n't play a first-person shooter with this , mind , but if you wanted to run ms office , email , chat , download a video , listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store , and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful mp3 player to do that all in , i 'd highly recommend checking this out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
it is a great size and amazing optical zoom included !####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
like the price and operation .####B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
when i finally had everything running with all my software installed i plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
they basically told me that the machine would be problem free now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unless you do n't care how long it takes to get going , find something else .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a waste of money from day one !####O O O O O O O O O O
easy to install also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for adsl cable or wifi .####B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
:] it arrived so fast and customer service was great .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
probably wo n't work either .####O O O O O O
i find myself using the 10-key more than i thought i would .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i purchased a zen satellite m60 ( with harman/kardon speakers ! ) in december of 2005 .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
however , i can refute that osx is " fast " .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
so , you can imagine how unhappy i am with this item .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
it is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good player , but i am very satisfied .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
it is , however , very heavy .####O O O O O O B-OP O
page just disappeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it was shooting sparks !####O O O O O
with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
if you 're looking for a great laptop , you 've found the best here .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
i am constantly trying to uninstall programs , clean cookies , and delete unused files .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i am loyal to apple .####O O O O O O
it was okay for over a week before the blue screens started occuring again .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
they only stay charged a little over an hour .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it 's fun to take to a bookstore , sit in the coffee shop area , sign in to wifi and look up book reviews of books i might buy .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a real touchpad , not the toy i saw in other brands .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
good computer and fast .####B-OP O O B-OP O
i would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a player it does not meet the expectations .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
great , quick to transfer the money .####B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
they have not sent the zen nor called .####O O O O O O O O O
i highly recommend this phone for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the only thing i miss is that my old alienware phone had backlit keys .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
really no problems with the hand me down computers i received from my children .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sd card reader is slightly recessed and upside down ( the nail slot on the card can not be accessed ) , if this was a self ejecting slot this would not be an issue , but its not .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O

* 2 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - called headquarters , they report that they have not looked at it yet but it is " on the top of the stack " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i work in film editing and post production , so i need an camera that not only has power , but memory and speed as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
big mistake !####O O O
after about another month i had to send it in again to acer for repairs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
having usb3 is why i bought this player .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O
anyway , i can ' t even remember how i finally got it taken care of , but i was done with sony after that !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has worked fine .####O O O B-OP O
it was quite easy .####O O O B-OP O
i recommend for word processing and internet users .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O
i have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the only thing that can be updated is the video , other than that you 're all set .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it has been to early to see if this actually fixes the problem or not though .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after a little more than a year of owning the zenxtra , the monitor has completely died .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i have recently converted back to a mac and i could n't be happier !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great g3 offers many great features !####B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it 's so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
i finally made the leap after my gateway crapped out on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything about this camera is not only visually appealing , but very easy to use .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
it 's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
overall i feel this dvd player was poor quality , had poor performance , although it did have great battery life when it did work .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
from the start , when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even if you do n't do business , thats okay , it 's incredibly fast .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
either way the entire thing was just a joke , a complete rip off !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
i really like the size and i 'm a fan of the acers .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
though please note that sometimes it crashes , and the sound quality isnt superb .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i enjoy very much my new toshiba , purchased specifically for attending online schooling .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i always swore by pcs and would never consider this camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to read in there .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
he did n't work for sony , he was just approved to fix their crappy products .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when i got my phone back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then i started experiencing issues again , everything from programs and drivers failing again , to it powering off for no reason , to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
i would never buy a g3 again .####O O O O O O O O
think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that is n't perfect about this dvd player is the speakers , they are not loud at all but i expected that .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
i have had my zen latitude for almost three years .####O O O O O O O O O O O

overall , still a very nice machine .####O O O O O B-OP O O
i love this player , and use it everyday to do something , and never lets me down .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i lost two items i was working on until i figured out what was happening .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you 'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my children wo n't even use it for their school work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will also say it is much better than i expected !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
being virus-resistant is a huge plus .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O
the player feels good and i type just fine on it .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
i was told that it seems to be a multi - component failure .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cost is more as compared to other brands .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
i was considering buying the air , but in reality , this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient , even though it 's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
the screen is a little glary , and i hated the clicking buttons , but i got used to them .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
the built quality is really good , i was so happy and excited about this product .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O
if you want more information on this phone i suggest going to apple .com and heading towards the zen page for more information of the applications .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
on the twelfth day that i had the notebook , i decided to go to dell 's website and update it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and mine had broke but i sent it in under warranty - no problems .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
from the get-go , the m6809 was unsteady in its operation ;####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the only thing i would change about it is the fm radio .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it 's a great product for a great price !####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
after doing extensive research , macconnection had the lowest price on the 15 " mbp i5 .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
in early may i got it back and this time i only had it back for 1 day before it had a new issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they " expedited " the repairs so i was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed , by a " senior tech " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
i took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and i finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
now for the hardware problems .####O O O B-ASP B-OP O
no complaints for this camera product .####O O O O O O O
i have aniphone , and ipad , so it just made sense to finish off the platform by adding the ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend this player to anyone looking to get an ipod who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
delivery was early too .####B-ASP O B-OP O O
looking online , many people are having the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O
very small and portable i 've had this dvd player about 12 hrs now and it 's better than expected .####O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the casing of the power cord fried and shocked my husband when he pulled it out of the socket .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
there was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system can ' t be used with the ibook .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it is very easy to navigate even for a novice .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
good player , long battery life , largest hard drive and gaming system .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i have used both pcs and the ipod and i have to say that i really really love the ipad book player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
recently there are a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the past few years , i 've had terrible experiences with apex .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i gave it to my daughter because i just hated the screen , hated that it had no cd drive to at least play cd 's when i wanted to listen to music and do schoolwork .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is always reliable , never bugged and responds well .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O
it took me a while top get away from the land of pcs , but now that i have , i can ' t see myself going back to it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the advantages of owning ' a ' player are numerous .####O O O O O O O O O O O
pros : the zen pro notebook has a large battery life and you wont have to worry to charge your player every five hours or so .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have never had it crash , randomly turn off ,####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i would buy it again in a heartbeat !####O O O O O O O O O
better stick with another brand .####O O O O O O
again - windows based machines were not giving me anything to work with !####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
it allows you to automatically upload photos to your facebook account with one click .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zen knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
skype is just so dang cool with this machine too .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
they told me it was my loss even though it was the computer , not what i 've done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other controls include firewire 800 , gigabit ethernet , magsafe port , microphone jack .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
compared to similarly spec 'd pcs , this machine is good value , well built and works easily right out of the box .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
unless you need the bluetooth 3 .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i called their repair depot as was told they would send me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
best buy rocks !####O O O O
they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'll wait and save up for this dvd player .####O O O O O O O O O O O
thank god for " ctrl z " bottom line , i 've been using apex since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i thought learning the compact flash would be hard , but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a pc .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
also the battery is completely shot .####O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
the driver updates do n't fix the issue , very frustrating .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
i also bought one for my wife , and 3 for my office .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
within 3 weeks the same issues started happening again .####O O O O O O O O O O
the fact that the screen reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury - when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or do n't want to bother them with bright lighting , it is very convenient to have a darker , softer lit screen .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i bought this player was the worst laptop i 've ever bought .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
at 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was also able to install and use my photoshop and after effects programs easily .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
as with any player not purchased with software options , it comes with a lot of what i consider useless applications .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the cover for the dvd drive soon came off , too -- a mark of poor construction quality .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
replaced this one with my player that was stolen , its a great computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i know apples are more expensive than pcs , but he thinks it is worth every penny .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us the zen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they freeze all the time .####O B-OP O O O O
what can i say .####O O O O O
i remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever i look at the small scratch that it has caused .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no hassle and no complaints .####O O O O O O
as for the ipod , this is our 3rd apple computer in the past 2 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i really wish i had done this years ago .####O O O O O O O O O O
i do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however i would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design of the zen as it is one very large heat sink .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
stopped booting up less than a week after my one-year warranty was up .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
it took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that i owned the warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
long story , but after many calls to various offices , i was told that no one can override the depot and that managers do n't take phone calls or e/mails .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
just bit the bullet and bought the phone hoping it will last a lot longer … .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't know why i did n't make the switch sooner... o ya because it 's expensive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
windows also shuts the computer down for no reason without warning .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
it still heats up like mad and i am unable to use it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after all was said and done , i essentially used that $ 450 savings to buy mp3 memory card , two seagate momentusxt hybrid drives and an owc upgrade kit to install the second hard drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
so happy with this purchase , i just wish it came with microsoft word .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
no startup disk was not included but that may be my fault .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
amazing performance for anything i throw at it .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
the fm radio does n't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O
creative also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free .####O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i worked in it retail sales before .####O O O O O O O O
very nice so far .####O B-OP O O O
quick and has i/p button placement .####B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
so glad i have gone this route!!####O O O O O O O
enabling the battery timer is useless .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i would never tell anyone to buy one either .####O O O O O O O O O O
it discharges too quickly .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
plus it is small and reasonably light so i can take it with me to and from work .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had purchased it from a major electronics store and took it to their service department to find out what the problem was .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
never been hacked .####O O O O
its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
i 'm extremely happy with my purchase as i now have the portable power i have been looking for .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 ) cut my losses and sold it for parts####O O O O O O O O O O
there were no scratches or dents or any marks at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had it four months when my disc drive refused to open .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O
i love this camera products .####O B-OP O O O O
i want the portability of a tablet , without the limitations of a digital and that 's where this laptop comes into play .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is a bit quiet if you 're on a plane , this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
u can do what u want in just few seconds , even to start up your computer takes few seconds .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
this player is a great buy .####O O O O B-OP O O
but if you 're willing to pay another 200 dollar for a windows disc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i bought a metz flash for it , but do n't always take it out ;####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
my friends are in awe every time they come over !####O O O O O O O O O O O
screen - although some people might complain about low res which i think is ridiculous .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
- when battery life went to 4 hours or less , took it to the machouse amsterdam for repair ( 26th of august ) .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for this purpose , it 's great .####O O O O O O B-OP O
it is so much easier to use####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP
wonderful features .####B-OP B-ASP O
" this is n't a big deal , i have n't noticed the issue with dvds or other media , only through usb output .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
true quality at a great price !####B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
and dell and best buy both refused to take it back after i only had it for 1 hour....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices , and usb devices are recognized almost instantly .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
keys stick periodically and i havent had this player for 45 days yet .####B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
nothing wrong with this computer at all !####B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
after the bad experience with this player went back to compaq .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
my husband uses it mostly for games , email and music .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i cant believe creative put this out .####O O O O O O O O
without a big ol' clunky machine in my backpack , i feel like i can do programming homework anywhere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i work with kids and they love making short videos on there .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
you can find many phones with the same performance and even better with lower price , but you can not find the look , easy , applications , and the experience in this phone .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
it 's annoying very much and i wo n't ever buy any acer products .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far , so good !####O O O O B-OP O
so i called , again .####O O O O O O
buy the ipod it 's a terribly great machine .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
but i was completely wrong , this phone is unbelievable amazing and easy to use .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
every time i log into the system after a few hours , there is this endlessly frustrating process that i have to go through .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i upgraded from a 5 year old player and was amazed to find out that this player is much slower then my old player .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i bought it for apex and so far it 's amazing !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
there is a blank lighted screen when i start and that is all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is probably an hour at best .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
3 ) horrible customer support####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
runs real quick .####B-ASP O B-OP O
i also wanted eax , which this one has .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i especially like the based student option .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
1 . you can not change your menu system ( window 's 7 starter does not support that function ) .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O
after that the said it was under warranty .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i would buy this lap top over and over again !####O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a much more streamlined system for adding programs , using the internet , and doing other things everyone does on a computer .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the notebook pc , the zen qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
garageband is easy to work with , like all the other apple applications i 've had experience with .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
this machine delivers .####O O O O
apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
thus , when you carry it at a slanted angle , the screen will " topple " or " slide " down , if you understand what i mean .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also the remote does not light up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the remote .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the baterry is very longer .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it made the computer much easier to use and navigate .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the bottom-line is that this player just is n't worth it .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the sound is nice and loud ; i do n't have any problems with hearing anything .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
screen is awesome , battery life is good .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the touchpad is very intuitive , so much so that i never want to use buttons to click again !####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
" i 've had it now about 2 months and absolutely love it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i initially purchased this dvd player 13 " in april , and i loved it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
adjust the sensitivity since it 's not that responsive to begin with .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O
the screen takes some getting use to , because it is smaller than an ipod .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
but the machine is awesome and ilife is great and i love snow leopard x .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
if someone called me an apex fanboy it would make sense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the not so good , i got the stock screen - which is very glossy .####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
could n't keep a page up you were working on !####O O O O O O O O O O O
i would buy one of these for every person in my office if i could .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i would not reccomend anyone buying this player####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
if you are looking for something reliable , this is the phone for you .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i fell in love with it .####O O O B-OP O O O
, applications respond immediately ( not like the tired ms applications ) .####O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
i would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
few cameras to catch ;####O O O O O
this player in new condition and operational , but for the audio problem when 1st sent for repair .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
mac computers automatically " defrag " each time you start your computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service i received from t-mobile went above and beyond the call of duty .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
the remote controls are hard to push .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
so far , so good .####O O O O B-OP O
the volume is really low to low for a player that is not expecting volume to be so low and i hate that about this player .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O
the os is fast and fluid , everything is organized and it 's just beautiful .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
and time printing works like a charm .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
we both recently got new cameras .####O O O O O O O
it 's a lottery at this point as i have read that other have received new ones with the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the auto-resource is very useful when chatting with other techs in remote buildings on our campus .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , my sister got the exact same player ( since they were so cheap ) and after 8 months , the screen split in half just from everyday use .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
excellent led monitor and well equipped .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
i 'm very impressed .####O O O B-OP O
i will have to purchase spy ware or nortell for privacy protection .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
in the three years i 've had the zenxtra , i have never had a phone on my computer , and i do a lot of work on the internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is easy to operate and i have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new rolls royce of laptops .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the battery life seems to be very good , and have had no issues with it .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i just bought this laptop 3 days ago .####O O O O O O O O O
awesome graphics !####B-OP B-ASP O
this player was awful !####O O O B-OP O
if you have much higher expectations than that... i would look elsewhere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can not even read what i am writing half of the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i believe i purchased this in dec 09 for my primary work phone which is used 5-10 hours a day , 4-6 days a week .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the speed is incredible and i am more than satisfied .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
windows [ vertigigy 's included player is an insult to it 's customers who pay good money for shoddy products .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O
could not keep up with me and finally the hard drive went out .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP O
did not enjoy the new g3 and touchscreen functions .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
about 1/2 of the sites i need to visit because of my work contain some type of flash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
good bye blue screen and critical errors!!!!####O O O O O O O
it is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O
good monitor and performed well .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O
i think the play is somewhere on the hard drive , but i rather have a hard copy .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a " different " computer .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the zen is also made better , my computer has never got a stop , and the laptop runs just as fast as the first day i bought it .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i paid about 18000 for this phone because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they really screwed the pooch on this one .####O O O O O O O O O
since i purchased my toshiba zen , i have been very pleased with it , i has a player and a desktop .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
almost 4 years ago i bought what was then the current , up to date hp pavilion -- if i recall correctly , it was the dv 1300 t .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my husband got me this for chrismas after getting me a very expensive player that did not work after 2 days .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
- i propose that i can just swap the hard drives .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
besides , the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
exactly that , users .####O O O O O
and as for all the fancy finger swipes -- i just gave up and attached a remote .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i also love the design , the looks , the feel , and the in-program digital camera is wonderfull .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i do not like too much button count .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i wanted it for it 's mobility and man , this little bad boy is very nice .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the zenxtra notebook , model nb 305-n410bl , is a great little computer .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i got what i paid for .####O O O O O O O
the first one i had was a 2006 model , not the pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the os is also very user friendly , even for those that switch from a pc , with a little practice you can take full advantage of this os !####O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i have t-mobile gotten superfine sandpaper and " fixed " the edges by rounding them off .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i was ready to take it back for a refund , but the geek squad came through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this g3 went bad on me after 3 days .####O O O O O O O O O O
then it ceased charging at all .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
hopefully my replacement is brand new .####O O O O O O O
but reasons we chose this apple computer .####O O O O O O O O
first the screen goes completely out .####O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
this camera meets every expectation and automatic reception is great !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
might have to buy one for me now , since i use it all the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has happened again and i 'm being told that it 's $ 175 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
screen , playback , and playback : if you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to the player the beautiful screen , responsive island mediasource , and fun multi-touch player is worth the extra $ to me alone .####B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
it is the worst computer dvd player ever made .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i purchased this phone while on a business trip to keep up with my email .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the only time i have restarted is during system updates .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i want my l505-s5988 back !####O O O O O O
i am not much of a computer techie , so i can understand some of the internal problems , though i do have trend micro as an antiviral program .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
my one complaint with this dvd player that i 've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
received all four in good order ;####O O O O B-OP O O
on two occasions the computer s calendar told me it was 1969 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the remote , which generally felt okay even for someone used to a remote control , now looks terrible .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
no tutorials on the display .####O B-ASP O O O O
i can ' t even turn it off .####O O O O O O O O O
hopefully amazon will take this back .####O O O O O O O
- they reported that the g3 in their headquarters .####O O O O O O O O O O
but , canon makes the switch from pc to phone easy .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
do not buy gateway computers they are junk and the warranty company is horrible .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i do n't know how i could ever live without my qosmio .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
owned apple computers and laptops for as long as i could remember .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
the so called laptop runs to slow and i hate it !####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O
i will not be using that slot again .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O
i could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
every driver on the drivers/applications dvd is everything you will need for a reload .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
first , it does not have a speakerphone to open the lid .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
not something you want to miss out on!!!####O O O O O O O O
that seemed to solve the problem , till i wrote an article with semicolons in it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no more lenovo for me .####O O O O O O
once open , the leading edge is razor sharp .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
the exterior is absolutely gorgeous .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
this player serves all my needs .####O O O O O O O
i investigated netbooks and saw the zen nb305-n410bl .####O O O O O O O O O
the # 1 reason that is always repeated .####O O O O O O O O O
the computer is currently in west verginia doe to the method of shipping chosen by t-mobile .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
in short i would never buy a compaq again .####O O O O O O O O O O
it really is perfect for work and play .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
and if you have aiphone or mp3 player you can connect and download songs to it at high speed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
that 's very possible , but since they do n't make windows xp drivers for the sound card in this machine , i was stuck until playlists came out .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
that defeated the whole point of a laptop .####O O O O O O O O O
i realize that not every unit has this issue , but the ones that do can not be repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did a lot of research and ended up thinking this toshiba was the best one for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
the battery is irreplaceable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the new operating system makes this computer into a super ipad .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
the key bindings take a little getting used to , but have loved this dvd player .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
finally , i could n't take it anymore and ordered my player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a great machine !####O O O B-OP O O
my wife also has problems with her asus - different model .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
instead of taking another chance on this dvd player , i went with an asus g73jh-x3 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the local computer repair shops send out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or computer usually even the trouble some zenxtra .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase####O O O O O O O O O
i practically have an ipod with all the " fixes " they have done !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and if you are a game player it works with world of warcraft wonderfully .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this by far beats any computer out on the market today built well , battery life amazing .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
thank you so much for the great item .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
and the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and playback .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
not using wired lan not sure what thats about .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
harddrive was in poor condition , had to replace it .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i 've had to call apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful , english speaking ( from vancouver ) techs that walked me through the processes to help me .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i hate it !####O B-OP O O
obviously one of the most important features of any computer is the " human interface .####O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
by this time i was regretting ever seeing this machine on the shelf !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first i have been searching for long time before i decided to get this player####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe not the cutting edge ( satellite l455d ) but it is a workhorse .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery is not as shown in the product photos .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
apple is unmatched in product quality , aesthetics , craftmanship , and customer service .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is my first lg product .####O O O O O O O
the hewitt packard pavillion dv6700 was my first laptop , before this i had a zenxtra that i loved .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
but the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
however i chose two day shipping and it took over a week to arrive .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
still have n't solved this .####O O O O O O
go for it !####O O O O
i might have read it incorrectly , but better safe than sorry right ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on 3 july 2004 , i purchased this model at best buy for about $ 150####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
worse , for the price i could get a * netbook * that outperforms this machine .####B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the price was very good , and the product is top quality .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i 've already upgraded o mavericks and i am impressed with everything about this computer .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i can not even imaging going back to the player after using this wonderful computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
she told me flatly , " it 's like that one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
btw , i checked online regarding the old g3 ' died ' and found that i was not alone , far from it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership , so it was covered by the applecare warranty plan .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i called apple and no solution .####O O O O O O O
features such as the dashboard ( allows you to view frequently used tools like a calculator , weather forecast , movie times , calendar , computer post its etc .####B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything i have tried has worked and i never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
we researched and found the best price at macconnection .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
it just works flawlessly !####O O B-ASP B-OP O
this ipod laptop is fabulous in both areas .####O O O O B-OP O O O O
it has a lot of memory and a great battery life .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
good luck with your purchase options .####O O O O O O O
but the performance of this player is a huge disappointment .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
i can ' t reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
wow the zenxtra hanged as i tried to type this review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
first things first , the zen has many applications to make life easier , unlike the windows computers .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O
when i am next to my router on my hp i get full service , on my eee pc i get 3 bars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the size is perfect and i do not recommend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
the player jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer , left right and front .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
none of the apex tech support staff knew what they were doing .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks .####O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
took me 11 hours , 3 trips to different fedex offices , and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse it support technicians in the world .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
english must have been his third or fourth language .####O O O O O O O O O O
its as advertised on here.... . it works great and is not a waste of money !####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O
- called machouse amsterdam to ask for a temporary replacement , no answer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it can ' t get any better .####O O O O O O B-OP O
again , decent comp for the price , and i was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sorry , newegg .####O O O O
i use a flash card but it does n't help .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O
this is a great little computer for the price .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
i ordered my 2012 ipod after being disappointed with spec of the new 27 " imacs .####O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i got the macbook and he got a zenxtra .####O O O O O O O O O O
the g3 a dream come true .####O O O O O O O
they are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i could n't be more pleased .####O O O O O B-OP O
when i got the computer back and realized it still was not correct creative told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
it crashes , and when it goes flat , it just dies ( like a pc , maybe worse ) and i loose all my open documents !####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
summary : i 've had this player for 2 months , out of the blue the power adapter stops working .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP O
since i 've had this player i 'd only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
- got it back 3 months later####O O O O O O O
very disappointed !####O B-OP O
this is my first computer purchase####O O O O O O
i paid $ 800 for this player from my school campus bookstore .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i homeschool my kids and with the zen next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , a zen will be a different story .####O O O O O O O O O O
because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time , we are on the hook for the repair .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
tried to make a recovery disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i would not recommend this product to anyone .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
the zenxtra satellite has been more than i expected for the price .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O
i had to have these computers in my school .####O O O O O O O O O O
i was n't a big fan of the netbooks but this one was very well designed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
my last computer , a zenxtra , cost only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
the macbooks worth every penny .####O O B-OP O O O
it 's not like i have used for half a year and then complained about it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i dual camera with linux and that other security-prone os and it performs flawlessly .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O
meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the aluminum body sure makes it stand out .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
shiny this camera is the best of the best !####O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
connecting to my wireless router via built-in wireless took no time at all .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i saw the apex mac at best buy and decided to get this as my replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i decided i wanted this player so i went into the bby store .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is really easy to use and it is quick to start up .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i tell everyone that i know , friends , family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i love the multi-touch trackpad .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the dvd drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .####O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
no complaints with their desktop , and maybe because it just sits on your player , and you do n't carry it around , which could jar the hard drive , or the remote .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O
and that was the fourth timeive sent it to them to get fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm now trying to decide on another mp3 model .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i was so happy with my new camera .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
i am an info sys major in creative , so i started researching this issue on my own .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the 6610 one megapixel a great computer .####O O O O O B-OP O O
in addition , there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the os takes some getting used to especially after being a windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it !####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the remote has a wonderful nature feel .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O
i sent it back and they lost it .####O O O O O O O O O
so not having my phone was discouraging .####O O O O O O B-OP O
you just get a trial version either way .####O O O O O O O O O
not worth it one bit .####O B-OP O O O O
good luck .####O O O
so what am i supposed to do ? the lg service center can not provide me the " service " when it is called the " special center " .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
it 's catatonic .####O O O O
remote control is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
love the speed , especially !####B-OP O B-ASP O O O
i have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had cameras 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
obviously we both got new ipod .####O O O O O O O
took that one home , same thing .####O O O O O O O O
web browsing is very quick with safari browser .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
falls into the case .####O O O O O
yeah , to you .####O O O O O
but it came back in even worse shape .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
so , if you 're thinking of a player , i would heartily recommend the apple 13 .3 zen notebook computer ( z0j80001 ) notebook for all your needs !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this dvd player !####O B-OP O O O O
the games included are very good games .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
runs hot i thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy this camera product .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
returning this as soon as i get out of work####O O O O O O O O O O
it is much better than the zen ultrabook i had before .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
who knows what will happen later on when they dismantle the whole damn thing ? so , i said i wanted a new set .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
user friendly , fast and high tech it is amazing !####B-OP I-OP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O B-OP O
one of the smartest thing i did was take my time to compare songs before making my purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the phone is really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run .####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
after years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting computer viruses , a good friend convinced me it was time to go the nomad route .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have the a65 - right now it 's a paperweight .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
while it was barely a bargin in the begining , i would never purchase another dell and would not recomend the zen brand to others .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
summary : they played games with me for the warranty period .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
somehow the system clock got messed up after reboot .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O
i had to call apple 19 times ( each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone ) , and take it to their store for evaluations , and diagnostics , 5 times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have never had any issues or problems with the zenxtra so far , and it is still as fast as it was when i first bought it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a power button .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
player is great , very quiet for all the typing that i do .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the program came with the computer and works beautifully .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive shipping to and from hp .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O

i 've already recommended this phone to a friend who eye 'd the computer when i took it out of my bag .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the quality , in general was less than the worth of the cheap player .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
i found this player on sale for under 6000 at best buy which was a great deal !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
because he said that the hinge is under the button and they have to dismantle the whole thing before it can be tightened .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my only problem is i can not reg . the product key .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it had most of the features and all of the power that i wanted to replace my ipod machine .####O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
every day i had this phone , something failed on it .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
lots of preloaded software .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
not a bad phone , it 's a bit slow , but gets the job done .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i will not hesitate to recommend it to family and friends####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
it took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't waste your money or time .####O O O O O O O O
i liked the aluminum body .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is my second digital camera , and it 's better than ever .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
2 . the wireless card is low quality .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O
the receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
it did n't come with any software installed outside of windows media , but for the price , i was very pleased with the condition and the overall product .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the computer was two weeks late in delivery because creative forgot to complete the required import paperwork .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it does get hot when using on a bed or sofa and gets warm on a desk... this is in an un-air conditioned room in air condition it gets slightly warm......####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i expected so as it 's an ipod product , but i was glad to see my expectations exceeded , this is the player to buy right now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
returned it .####O O O
i love the operating system and the preloaded software .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is my first dell i heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it !####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
it 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a notebook .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i shipped out on saturday , july 17 .####O O O O O O O O O
i will never complain about the price since i believe you get what you pay for and the zen was worth every dollar .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the speakers on it are useless too .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
i 've have n't had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the battery lasts as advertised ( give or take 15-20 minutes ) , and the entire user experience is very elegant .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
upon giving them the serial number the first thing i was told , was that it was out of warranty and i could pay to have it repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i use it mostly for content creation ( audio , video , photo editing ) and its reliable .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
cheaper than buying it @ apple too !####B-OP O O O O O O O
it is amazing .####O O B-OP O
performance is much much better on the ipod especially if you install an ssd on it .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
it was a great player , ran great and was really fast .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP O
my favorite by far , although the most expensive , was my sony .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
was searching online for a power supply when i found this site .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
we love the size of the screen , although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
was a great deal i will give that .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
the 13 " zen pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to ca this is the best price we can get for a great product .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
i have owned many computers and phones .####O O O O O O O O
buy this .####O O O
recommended to people as their first phone .####B-OP O O O O O O O
but after using it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i grew up in a design family so it only made sense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this player is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
it works !####O O O
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happening so hopefully we can get this dvd player very soon !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh my goodness - i am not a happy camper .####O O O O O O O O O O O
easy to carry , can be taken anywhere , can also hooked up to printers , headsets .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you might think , i am new in this game , but i am a gadget lover , and have had more than 2 dozens dvd 's 15 years , and none gets this hot , that fast .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing is that the battery wo n't last more than 1/2 an hour .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
it is absolutely horrible to use , despite all its so called advanced features .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
kind of annoying , but i still love this camera .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
the display is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
consumer report recommended toshiba .####O O B-OP O O
it is so simple to use , i use it more than my ipod .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i purchased two apex ( for my husband and 16 year old daughter ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this " never " happen...####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a hard decision for me since the zenxtra looked so appealing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
fast , great screen , beautiful apps for a phone ; priced at 1100 on the ipod website ; amazon had it for 1098 + tax - plus i had a 10 % off coupon from amazon - cost me 998 plus tax - 1070 - otd !####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
if you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just buy the case and be happy , plus it looks nice , i bought the white one from best buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is amazingly long at 7 hrs and 5 hrs if you use it .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
while most people say that pcs hold functionality and value and macs are just pretty to look at , i think there 's something to be said about the simplicity of this camera .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
the delivery was fast , and i would not hesitate to purchase this player again .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
and it did n't show up on the reciept , i do n't know how we ordered it online !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
i am glad i did my research .####O O O O O O O O
the other day i had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town - lots of people , little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
perfect -- thanks so .####B-OP O O O O
by the way teachers , they offer a discount which helps !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
no good .####O B-OP O
posted nov 8 , 2010 - two weeks ago i bought this notebook .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the i5 blows my player out of the water when it comes to rendering videos .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i never had this kind of quality issue with this camera ( not to say this camera is that great ) , not with a brand camera .####O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
yet this player continues to function properly .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
i have had the luxury ( sarcasm ) of owning 2 of these phones .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mousepad is a huge pain in the arse !####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
screen is bright and gorgeous .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
that being said after 2 weeks of owning every time i start it up now it gives me a black screen for 5-8 seconds stating pxe-e61 media test error check cable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that being said , it still runs video in full screen decently .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will not buy another one .####O O O O O O O
my smart phone is faster !####O O O O B-OP O
even though it is much more expensive than many pc players , it is worth the price .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i should have kept my big , old camera .####O O O O O O O O O O
i had a macbook notebook , and it had absolutely no protection from viruses , spyware , malware , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this flaw unfortunately detracts from everything else apple got right with the mini .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
quietest camera i have ever owned .####B-OP O O O O O O
i have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP O
i do not plan on going back .####O O O O O O O O
they transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you can ' t understand what they are saying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what a waste of time it was to run a defrag on the pc !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like the brightness and adjustments .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
luckily , t-mobile said they would replace my phone with a new one , but instead i got a refund and bought this phone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the whole experience is horrible so save up and buy a better player .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
biggest complaint is manual support .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
:) in the past four years i 've had it zen once gotten a phone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was slow , locked up , and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O
small and still very powerful .####B-OP O O O B-OP O
i can ' t say enough of how satisfied i am with their product and help aftermarket .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i was looking for this player which is portable and has all the features that i was getting for .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
may be better for the occasional web surfer .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted to spend around $ 700 to $ 800 so i was directed to a nice looking player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
after 4 days , being denied 6 times and told off once , i managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
how does the power supply not work!!!####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
it has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( the ibook backup also uses a firewire connection ) .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
needs constant repair .####O O O O
then to make matters worst , there is noone that they can transfer you to .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a long and tiring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
he loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
while the player itself is alright , the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the shooting player .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the battery life was supposed to be 6 hours , but even if i ran off the battery with the high efficiency setting the battery would only last me on average about 2 .5 to 3 hours .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just what i needed for portable and my wallet too !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the g3 delivered as promised .####O O O O O O
i am also upset with cr for giving a good rating .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i 've had it for about 2 months now and found no issues with software or updates .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i would definitely recommend checking out this player if you are in the market for one .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that bums me out about this purchase is they released a newer updated mbp seriously right after i bought this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it should n't happen like that , i do n't have any design app open or anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O

took the g3 on a vacation trip and i was able to do whatever i wanted to do without lugging a much heavier player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had this dvd player for three years now and still love it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
but no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it on their website!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the capabilities using that program alone made me want this player .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i 'm very happy with this machine !####O O O B-OP O O O O
i work on this player at home and have used pc all through college .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got the black g3 two years ago and have never regretted it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my sister is the electronics manager at wal mart and she says that hp is the best .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the best thing about this camera is the price along with some of the newer features .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the new mbp offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase this dvd player in 18 months .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't really have a complaint .####O O O O O O O O
but in fact it is totally the opposite .####O O O O O O O O O
it is much faster than my ip which is a core2 quad running at 2 .83 ghz .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
enjoy your sit down####O O O O
i 've had this phone for about a month now .####O O O O O O O O O O O
by the time i was finally able to get a work order to get it fixed i had been without my computer for almost a week while i was an online college student , so it was very inconvenient and i had to send it off and be without it while it was being fixed also .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
have returned that phone unused .####O O O O O O
the shop will definitely push the problem to the service center .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
one more tip , please purchase this model and get a 40gb flash card to save you $ 10####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
do you think the shop will give me a new set?? it will not !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a month later , we reinstall the notmad compact flash card .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

boots up fast and runs great !####B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O
startup in about 30 seconds , shutdown in 2-4 seconds , resume from sleep in 0-2 seconds .####B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
i returned the 2nd dvd player a full refund .####O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is a lot of the software i have wo n't work with apex and iwork is not worth the price of it .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
you can imagine that an expensive item as this player will not be left on your front steps , it needs signature to pove that you received it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was having a though time deciding between the zenxtra air or the zonxtre 13 " ( both baseline models , priced at 1 ,200 $ retail )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
my zen is probably the best investment i have ever made .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had stop button####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP
it suddenly can not work .####O O O O B-ASP O
simple to use , and great graphics .####B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
i give this player a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i 'm hoping the rest of the features will be the signature quality of this camera .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i am now frustrated that i still have to use my work issued windows phone !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love everything about it .####O B-OP O O O O
i currently own a lenovo camera as well as my zenxtra pro , and each have their own strengths and weaknesses .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did not even have it a year .####O O O O O O O O O
the g3 i recieved was everything it should have been .####O O O O O O O O O O O
let 's just get this out of the way , i love apple !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O

i can ' t honestly say i was heartbroken .####O O O O O O O O O O
in the short time of one month since the 2012 zen was released there are well over 1000 posts regarding this issue and the numbers keep rising .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the unibody design is edgy and durable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
you will not regret it , promise you !####O O O O O O O O O
they sent out a sony ' certified ' technician .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
right size and weight for portability .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
its fast and another thing i like is that it has three digital zoom .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is still a fairly good upgrade to an ipod that was about 4 years old .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i had this phone for one month and had to send it in for repair .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you can afford a digital camera , and are in the market for one , of course , then definitely go for this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hope this helped !####O O O O
it is trash !####O O B-OP O
not too much " junk " software to remove .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
they would repair one thing , send it back and it would still have the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the zen pro notebook will not let you down .####O O O O O O O O O O
when i called toshiba , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $ 35 for the phone call , even though they did n't offer any technical support .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it 's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O

i have a laptop as my regular computer , but found that disconnecting it and lugging it around was a drag .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
suffice it to say , the zen keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O

still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the upgrade .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O

besides the great look , it is a great machine .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O

this is especially disheartening when apple prides itself as the choice of creative professionals .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price####B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP
support has been lackluster and now i just want a refund .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O

the price premium is a little much , but when you start looking at the features it is worth the added cash .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
one suggestion i do have , is to not bother getting 17xn flash card expecting it will work just like you knew it to on the player .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the use it was purchased for it is a good player .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
all was well .####O O B-OP O
all in all , i 'm incredibly dissatisfied with this camera , and with this as a whole .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it was so exciting for me to unwrap my new player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this camera has shown .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O
yes , the 6610 is more expensive than competing pc laptops .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
my only issues are : 1 ) the screen/video resolution wo n't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i have owned macbook pros since 2005 and this is the best yet !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O

i 've had my macbook player since august 2009 .####O O O O O O O O O O
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but you must get the 15 inch .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the eax has never failed me , and i expect it to be the same for this computer as well .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pretty much made sense to get a mini .####O O O O O O O O O
the remote is dead !####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i paid for extra memory and the 17-inch screen , as well as the top of the line dvd and cd burners .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
it still serves me well both in business and home needs .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the pricing is very competitive .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
do n't buy this model .####O O O O O O

as an owner of a zen satalite player computer things you should know before you buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it seems they could have updated xp and done without creating playlists .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
who makes a zenxtra rest on your lap ?####O O O O O O O O O
the layout of the g3 is horrible and confusing ;####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O

great machine if you want to drop the cash for one .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O

now i know !####O O O O
it has no remote but , i can always buy and install one easy .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i just hope this expensive laptop does n't go dead like my friends... it did last him 5 good years before it bit the dust .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you are a person like me , more on the g2 , this camera has something for you too .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- when i started worrying for not hearing anything from them , i tried to call .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they do n't crash .####O O O O O
it is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an alienware camera machine .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are so many things wrong with this product , it just makes me want to set my self on fire !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got the blue screen of death the first month i got it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it would not let me connect to my wifi system where i lived .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the controls went on me , the fan went and the button went .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O
i would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use , stylish , fun , awesome computer .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O
also , it hardly ever crashes .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
i do n't like this company nor the zen brand , and i 'll never buy another one because i 've put more into it then it is worth .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was disappointed when i realized that the player does n't light up on this model .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
it has everything you need to get the job done .####O O O O O O O O O O O
its by far faster and more stable then my pc .####O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O
there is a fm radio which is perfect for typing in the dark .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
amazing product as you would expect from apple .####B-OP O O O O O O O O
this dvd player is the best investment that i have ever made .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
they sent it off and within 2 weeks i had it back good as new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
they were able to set-up with apex themselves within a few minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O
when it broke i wanted another player and chose the v5 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the programs that come standard with the leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
only issue is that it is a little slow , and i 'm fixing that by adding more play .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
also , the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i was even able to uninstall mcaffe and install one of my symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to return it for a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O
best buy - 5 stars + + + ( sales , service , respect for old men who are n't familiar with the technology ) dell computers - 3 stars photoshop software - owes a me a couple####B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
speakers too small to be of any real use .####B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
i always have used a tower home pc and jumped to the player and have been very satisfied with its performance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
still trying to learn how to use it .####O O O O O O O O O
even if apple replaces whatever needs replacing i wonder if , since i seem to be doubling the amount of time i get out of it each time it 's " like new , " i might have 8 months next time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
prior to this computer , i owned a powerbook g4 for 6 years ( quite a long time for a laptop ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , maybe i was just very unlucky .####O O O O O O O O O
( i found a 2gb stick for a bit under $ 50 ) nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours , or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my hp g60-244dx died after only 16 months .####O O O O O O O O O
the read button is good but should have splurged for 8mb instead of 4mb .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
even though i had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i just recently had to ship my laptop back to hp for repair .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like the lighted screen at night .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
how the zen handles the repair seems to vary , some folks indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix , others had the repair done 5 times .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
extremely disappointed with the way it is .####O B-OP O O O O O O
$ 999 .00 tax free .####O O O O O O
the screen is huge and colorful , but no led backlighting .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
so noise is reduced at least 50 % and the heat is much better , now it does n't feel hot but warm .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i have had my zenxtra i5 for a couple of days and have recycled all of my old pc phones .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

your cursor will end up all over the freaking place , , , it 's not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words , sentences , paragraphs because of this mousepad .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this is no exception .####O O O O O
it is fast and easy to use .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
good price .####B-OP B-ASP O
so this review might be a tad bit bias .####O O O O O O O O O O
windows xp sp2 caused many problems on the computer , so i had to remove it .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i have found also , it is very easy to be able to access wireless internet access ;####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

i will never buy another computer from dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how i was treated by the company .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

i would highly recommend this one to my friends####O O O B-OP O O O O O
taking it anywhere was a pain !####O O O O O B-OP O
i love the dock where i can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program , and the program will simply open that file .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it 's fast and dependable .####O O B-OP O B-OP O
do you think i purposely " destroy " my netbook , so that i can demand a new set ? do you read it 's fun to take public transport all the way to the service center and get a non-satisfactory solution ? or rather no solution .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
small enough to use on a long flight , light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips .####B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
for me i was lucky and a local store was selling them for $ 2000 off and best buy matched their price so i was able to buy one for under $ 1000####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
they claim that i should be happy because i am getting this dvd player to replace my two-month old player .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
believe me apple has a reputation .####O O O O O O O
i definitely suggest getting an extended warranty , you will probably need it !####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
size : i know 13 is small ( especially for a desktop replacement ) but with an external monitor , who cares .####B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
i let my friend borrow it , and she knows nothing about computers , and so used it with ease .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
thank you best buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software - you guys were great too !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
they 're absolutely useless , unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they say sorry out of warranty .####O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O
i am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great !####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the machine itself is alright .####O O O O B-OP O
the zenxtra designed to fail !####O O O O B-OP O
the g3 is way too overpriced for something so simple and chaotic .####O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP O
it 's color is even cool .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
of course , emachines can not be made entirely to blame for this camera 's woes ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

apple is one of the best computer companies in the country .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
however , if i sound enthusiastic about this , i am !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
when considering this player , look at the total cost of ownership and not just the initial price tag .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
programs would crash all the time , and it turned out to be a very unstable , unreliable player for me .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O
i have never had an experience like this .####O O O O O O O O O
do not purchase this laptop .####O O O O O O

well , i have to say since i bought this player , i wo n't ever go back to any windows .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this one still has the cd slot .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it was n't worth it .####O O O B-OP O O
in my line of work , i often have to take work home , and this makes it so easy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i took the computer into best buy where i purchased it and they kept it over night to study it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bought it to use mostly for online classes .####O O O O O O O O O
i can ' t begin to say how disappointed i am .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i use this for my tutoring business , and since i 'm always bouncing from student to student , it is ideal for portability and battery life ( yes , it gets the 8 hours as advertised ! ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

very good quality and well made .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O
the features are great , the only thing it needs is better speakers .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i 'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the ' old ' way - and apple does , indeed , have the better idea .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they offer the best warranty in the business , and do n't 3rd party it out like the ipod .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but for now , this camera is still a workhorse .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's not a wear-and-tear issue , not due to user carelessness and most importantly , they can ' t guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and i have to accept the outcome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
it is the best all around camera .####O O O B-OP O O O O
