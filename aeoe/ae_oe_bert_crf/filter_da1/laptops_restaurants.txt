the restaurant may be small but it is one heck of a power horse .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average restaurant , but keeps itself cleaned up and ready for the evening .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , you have to adjust yourself to what it will do , not what you want it to do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

yes , this place is much more money than the average restaurant out there , but there is no comparison in style , decor and just cool factor .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
- estimated time to fix it : 10 working days or less .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did not have to call the waiters at all .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
it 's a bummer and one out of five is being kind .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this thai restaurant is intimate , powerful , and service super quiet and cool .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
it does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
after much effort and 10 days as we replaced it the wifi is very weak .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
after that i turned to the waiter in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the service was still valid .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i had read online that some users were having sound problems .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O

it is very slim , the track pad is very much impressed with me .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
but for those of you that dont have the bill and are still on the wait 's this is a good foot in the door into mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
also the display is exceptional !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i purchased this new york after my original indian food and laptop expired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

all waitstaff are always willing to help you out with anything , no matter when you went to this restaurant and how many years passed .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
within a few hours i was using the gestures unconsciously .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O

great menu and quality .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O
so having the ac plug go out on me and get lose or i could actually try it inside my table on two of the three times is not good .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
when calling the restaurant for help , return , or the food , they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i know there are way better laptops out there for the same price , and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesnt suck total monkey balls .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i love the way the entire appetizer menu works together .####O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O

i can say that i am fully satisfied with the service that this place has supplied .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i 'm very disappointed in this restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O O O
again i sent it back and they replaced the ingredients and some fan inside .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O

the owner is tarnished in my heart .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
it has a very high bar , just for what i needed for .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
but other then that i would give this place a 4 in hafe stars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i like to go to the race track to handicap the horse races .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall for the money this is a good deal .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
great things come in small " packages .####B-OP O O O O O O O
it is short on space , and downloads always had problems being completed , or were said to be ' corrupted ' .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can do absolutely anything and is very fast and stylish .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O

it is her first sushi place and she is thrilled .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
so when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is the perfect size and menu for me .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
however the frozen screens kept happening .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
me and my boyfriend went the gateway nv78 in nov of 09 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one year of trying to fix this restaurant by myself , with help of friends , and even help from sushi experts i have given up on trying to try it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm just really happy that i waited to order , because this thing kicks a $ $ !####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and that probably explains why i 've already had my sata controller go bad within a year of buying it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the mini 's body has n't changed since late 2010 - and for a good reason .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O

got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O

if your time is worth anything to you , if you are tired of rebooting , reformatting , reinstalling , trying to find drivers , ifyou want a computer to work for you for a change , make the change to this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i am stuck with a laptop that i can not do very much with .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after 20-30 min the staff of the restaurant switched off .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the reaction of the waiters is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention the restaurant 's require .####O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it is extremely fast and never lags .####O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O
i just ca n't fathom that the celebrated indian food would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products - it only survives b/c its substandard restaurants are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising questions .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i honestly love my mac , thats why i am a self proclaimed mac addict .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this was an experience from an early indian food restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O
however , this restaurant has a fatal flaw that i discovered merely a week after buying it .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O
we have occasional restaurant users before , but most recently owned a budget restaurant since it is what we could afford .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the track pad to me is what really stands out though , you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the trackpad , awesome thinking apple !####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O

not enough time for me to give it 5 stars !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the menu is n't huge , but that does n't matter when i output media to the 50 inch lcd tv .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would say that 85 % of the design industry is french for good reason .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also does not have ambience .####O O O O O B-ASP O

i 've always used nyc for work home and this is my first experience with this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe the wine list improvement were not the restaurant they want to offer .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
my only gripe would be the need to add more portions .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the restaurant is a great price and has a sleek look .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
avoid this model .####O O O O

i hate to say this , but if i could take this back to the table and get my money back , then i would .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
either way , the wine is unsatisfactory .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it can not save the correct date and time i set .####O O O O O O O O O O O O

i have a friend who has the other sandwiches and we put them side by side with the same bagel in ( battle of the smithsonian ) after on hour mine was at 53 % life left and his was at 69 % life right .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i love my samsung tv and galaxy s smartphone , but this restaurant was a very poor restaurant .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the waitstaff was not helpful as well .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O
i can do everything i could before , only faster and more efficiently .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
also kinda loud when the fan was running .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O
they said it was a small error on this type of restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i left the place angrily .####O O O O O O
delivery was quick and product described was the food sent and so much more...####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
does a great job with video shot on a canon 5d mkii .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
we are addicted to this place .####O O B-OP O O O O
and in 6 months , there have been no freezing up and no blue , purple , black or any other type of gem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the " abuse " is that i pushed the counter service in too hard .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
many thanks , overstock .com .####O O O O O O
overall , this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i have recommended this place to everyone i know who is buying one .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
this is something i would deffinately recommend to someone .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O
went with a credit card .####O O O O O O
the macbook rarely requires a hard reboot .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i ca n't believe how quiet the ambience is and how quick this thing boots up .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i tried giving it 0 stars but i had to choose at least one , but imo no stars####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it !####O B-OP O O
i have nothing to regret from this new restaurant .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
what 's really great about this place is you may have a family member who is illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on the spot without any real supervision .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did not like my acer .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O
i can do pretty much 75 % of what i do on my sat on my kitchen table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a bad experience but i played down its importance .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i saw this one , and i have the most difficult time trying to use them , they 've made great dust collectors , i hate putting this place down####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
the food was awful , i would never recomend it to another person .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
the thai food is a fantastic place .####O O O O O B-OP O O
simple details , crafted aluminium and real glass make the place blow away the other plastic ridden , bulky sticker filled bagel####B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
comes with imovie ;####O O B-ASP O
set up was a breeze .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
but i am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
return it .####O O O
i took the place back in yet again except this time they kept it a small place into their geek squad headquarters .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it feels cheap , the staff is not very sensitive .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
needless to say i told them no and have a nice day and hung up !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find the place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they definitely have a superior product !####O O O O B-OP O O
i would like to use a different sake menu altogether .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
they are not .####O O O O
i am not happy at all with the product i purchased .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i 'd recommend this place to anyone !####O O B-OP O O O O O
but other than that i am blown away by all the features this place offers .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O
it 's the mid 2012 version .####O O O O O O O
the dv4 boasted a bigger menu , more portions , and a bigger wine selection than the nyc , plus a better quality wine list , nicer service , and many other features .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
overall , i experienced a huge change in that the food was packed pretty fast compared to nyc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i had my first mac and am glad i did .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it may take a little getting used to but you do n't have to worry about headaches or other headaches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i went here during the recent comex it show .####O O O O O O O O O O
my dad has one of the very first toshibas ever made , yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
the sushi is amazing .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
good in every aspect .####B-OP O O O O
other thoughts : received sushi 16 days later .####O O O O O O O O O
no spicy tuna rices dish is included .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O
i am paying this place to kill my self and my wallet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are so realistic i am just speechless .####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
searched it on amazon and on bestbuy .####O O O O O O O O
i think that was a great decision .####O O O O O B-OP O O
it has a way over the top - nearly to the point of being dangerous .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
i went right out and purchased another laptop .####O O O O O O O O O
i was very worried about making the two compatible - but literally , it was so simple i was almost worried that i was doing something wrong .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i found the mini to be : exceptionally delicious and set up####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP
i 'm new - just switched from years of food frustration .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i use them for my college age grandchildren and these macs are totally reliable and support their class work 100 % of the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
yes , i have it on the highest available setting .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i was given this restaurant as a birthday present and could n't be happier with it 3 years later .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
that 's a huge difference .####O O O O O O
i have now lived in this place for 1 .5 months and love it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
apple did a great job .####O O O B-OP O O
i love the form factor .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
its not just slow on the internet , its slow in general .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O
i 'm going back to sushi .####O O O O O O O
i my wife is also now the proud owner of a macbook as well !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its everything mac offers .####O O O O O
a second problem involves the battery which is advertised as having a storage life of 11 hours but when fully charged shows only 7 hours of service .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the lesson learned here is : it does not pay to by this loyal to any restaurant , since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible , as fast as they can , and in this day and age , the customer no longer is right all the times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i loved it .####O B-OP O O
the photographs on this computer are also stellar - very clear and vivid .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-OP O
the thunderbolt port is awesome !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i had finally reached my limit and broke down .####O O O O O O O O O O
we figure that after everything his food actually ended up costing $ 350 more than my original meal .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
would pay more for it if i had too !####O O O O O O O O O O
not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
the bagel is very sturdy and versatile .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i recently ate the mini and absolutely love it !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i regret buying it before understanding how awful it is and service .####O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
i would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
its also fun the decor !####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i love the dvd burner .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
such as pages , numbers , and so on .####O O O O O O O O O O
great deal on an amazing lap top !####B-OP O O O B-OP O O O
still pretty pricey , but i 've been putting off money for a while as a little macbook fund , and finally got to use it .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have owned at least 4 to 5 laptops and tables - but this is by far the most superior restaurant i have ever been .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i have had it 9 months and it is already a $ 250 loss .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with awesome sushi and assuring security , it 's perfect !####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O
cons : price is a bit ridiculous , kinda heavy .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
logic board utterly fried , cried , and laid down and died .####B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
and i babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
would highly recommend this place , though .####O O B-OP O O O O O
i get a ton of compliments on its size , and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus , i can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you 're restricted to the width of your body for computing room .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
his language was so bad i swore i was taking the turing test , and it was failing .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i returned it to best buy on the ninteenth of april .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place sucks####O O B-OP
which is what i did , check out my bagel 5517 !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
words can not express how much i love my new restaurant .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
but if you ca n't make your product last more than a year , you will not get my business again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i sent it back and found this time that the sauce was faulty , so i got a new one and some other fixes they found .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , i had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my sat , but took the bill to the conference .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sure hope best restaurant will try it asap .####O O O O O O O O O
only good thing is the sake menu .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
out of all the laptops i have owned , this is by far the best !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i absolutely love my pizza !####O O B-OP O O O
i told them that i just received my brand new macbook but i was having issues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the food at this restaurant is no exception .####O O O O O O O O O
very powerful especially for the money .####O B-OP O O O O O
i have never really been big on downloading anything so i was n't too worried about getting a virus , plus i thought i was protected by norton .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this place running .####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
since i have always used apple rolls , the choice of macbook pro was obvious .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've almost have bought every generation of macminis since 2005 , and this one has n't let me down .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is also fast as can be... you get what you pay for... well worth the investment####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
heck , i like all the computers , but they 're all way too pricey for the kind of economy the u .s . is going through .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally pulled the trigger and i am blown away by how much more i enjoy the tasks in the restaurant!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it would n't fit in most 17-inch bags .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
the netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
great place for school , delicious food for beginners in the household .####B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
then , within 5 months , the charger crapped out on us .####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O
winters is on it 's way and i imagine it will be cozy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
which i still ny have hooked up to my tv .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i am pc users .####O O O O O
what a waste .####O O B-OP O
in summary , take your money elsewhere .####O O O O O O O O
i am forever changed and will no longer go to restaurants based here for personal taste .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
images are crisp and clean .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
the majority of the reviews seem to be for the 13 .3 japanese restaurant # md101ll/a .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i spent months looking for a good place to eat me and i finally found it !####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i saw walmart had the same bagel about $ 650 but still knowing what i know now , i would not go back at that price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary product key .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
bottom line , i doubt you 'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
you just lose a customer .####O O O O O O
two of the times was in one month .####O O O O O O O O O
i took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of indian####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
they are closed at 9 pm eastern .####O O O O O O O O
at least those computers did n't just die on us like this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this thing is a lemon .####O O O O O O
they replaced it and so far so good .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
the waitstaff was shorter than expected .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
i can guarantee this will be the last dell i will ever visit !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is nice , side view angles are pretty good .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
i am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when i got back in town .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not recommend this company or their products!!!!####O O O B-OP O O O O O
when the buyer returned it wal mart just boxed it , taped it shut resold it as new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we carry the bagel around here and there , hence it 's kinda of irritating when the lcd just " slide " downwards .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
this is the first time for me to go to this place and i 'm really happy with the move .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
well , they do n't care a bunch .####O O O O O O O O O
but until now , no complains at all .####O O O O O O O O O
it is in the best condition and has a really high quality .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
a tip for people looking into this place : do not go there save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can throw anything at it ( and i do ) , pictures , food , schoolwork .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm honestly afraid that it will burn me , it 's that hot !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and i have never had any issues with it freezing .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if that is the case for you , i would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate it .####O B-OP O O
it 's absolutely wonderful and worth the price !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
the food really well .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
all in all great item highly recommend it .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O
out of the box i noticed how small it was and was exactly what i was looking for .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it has spent more time in sushi shops than i can possibly recount here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ca n't close the 2nd hdd bay since there are brackets you have to break off ( even then , it still does n't shut ) that could be a major flaw for the dual hdd user .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i went my first sushi place after seeing the food demonstrated .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the white wood grilled cheese is almost pure hd .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
very disappointed becase i have had toshibas for years , and never a issue .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the menu shows great colors .####O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i am not one to throw things like this around but it is a restaurant so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little , while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant blinks it shuts off at will .####O O O O O O O O O
actually , i had noticed the one on the sales floor also did n't have sound !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i ordered this at an amazing price from amazon and it arrived just in time .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the toshiba net book operates very well .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i hate it !####O B-OP O O
buying a new york would allow me to make the transition .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food fine , and all the service seems to run pretty well .####O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
a great college tool !####O B-OP O O O
it was truly a great restaurant costing less than one thousand bucks before tax .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O
was debating to buy one for months , checked out different stuff on youtube , and read different articles and debates , i just didnt really wan na spend the money but im glad that i did .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
being a sushi restaurant user my whole life....####O O O O O O O O
bought from wal-mart , i believe that the food was a repaired item .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we were very happy i had the mac , well worth the extra money .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O

i 'm so glad to try a mac and not another chicken!!!####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
loaded with bloatware .####O O B-ASP O
while many people brag about mac being " intuitive " , it does take a little time to adjust to coming from a small , but once i got the hang of it , i do n't want to go back .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' gateway m-50 or 150 early 2007 .####O O O O O O O O O
so , buyers beware !####O O O O O
the staff is bright and vivid and the food is very good and the place is very important for use quick typers .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O

i 'm overall pleased with the interface and the portability of the food .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
stop living in the stone age and go back , you will not be sorry at all!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
because it is a defective restaurant .####O O O O B-OP O O
i had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity , because it is very sensitive .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
no restaurant has come remotely close to causing as many problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i came from the nyc and now i am so glad i switched when i needed a place to eat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
took several hours with waitstaff before i could even start the dish out of the box .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has all the expected features and more + plus a wide menu and more than roomy seating .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
deal of the year .####O O O O O
the only problem is a lack of ambience !####O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the display is incredibly bright , much brighter than my powerbook and very crisp .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
it 's just what we were looking for and the service great .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
love it .####B-OP O O
all of them were sushi machines .####O O O O O O O
they respond : " your dissatisfaction is noted "...####O O O O O O O O O

so then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back , but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened , and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the table ( the price of the table one ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O

this version of the restaurant is on a third-generation cpu ( " ivy bridge " ) , not the latest fourth-generation haswell cpu the 2013 version has .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches , dents or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of damage could happen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was important that it was powerful enough to do all of the tasks he needed on the internet , word processing , graphic design and decor .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O

it is light and the wait last a very long time .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O

another great thing is the dining scene .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it super shiny , so you can see the fingerprints easily .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O
i was wrong !####O O O O
very fast boot up and shut down .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
wifi capability , pre-loaded and multiple bluetooth slices to connect scale and printers was all that was required .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a tough choice .####O O O O O O
the touch pad is fine - again , it 's a real touch pad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
no big deal .####O O O O

i thought the price was great for the specs .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O
this is not best buy 's fault .####O O O O O O O O
i had gotten this place for $ 1199 .00 on my state 's tax-free weekend and had a $ 100 off coupon for a glass of wine at the local bestbuy !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you find yourself in the market for indian food ( and have the money ) do n't exclude looking at the mbps .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i own other macs but always find myself navigation to the sushi restaurant to get my work done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is by far the best , most reliable sushi i could find .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O
a great feature is the spotlight search : one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword , rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the wine list selection that comes with the food is so simple the service and produces a great finished meal .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
i swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to try a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apparently under the table there are 2 little screws and when the table gets moved back and forth , they come loose .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
there is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's just as fast with one menu open as it is with sixteen open .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
this was a great deal for a decked out japanese restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
my last restaurant gave me a constant battle even though it was also completely new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
getting the hot chocolate tridge is a must .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
in fact , he said , about 10 % of their food failed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
even set at the highest level , this place sacrifices its queen every time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never buy anything from here again !####O O O O O O O O O
i do n't want to run a restaurant ; i want to try a restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the 13 " macbook pro just fits in my budget and with free prices and no tax to ca this is the best price we can get for a tasty meal .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O

i just bought a laptop for college , and so far i am very happy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal hours can get more than 2 .5 hrs out of it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is the volume control .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
needless to say , not too happy with this place .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O
on my powerbook g4 i would never use the trackpad i would use an apple bar because i did n't like the track pad .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i was informed that i need to call some 0900 number first .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

amazing quality !####B-OP B-ASP O
i would recommend this place to anyone searching for the perfect sushi place and the wine list is amazing .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
and this is n't just my one experience .####O O O O O O O O O
i was so excited to receive the thai food l455 as a gift/bonus for some work i had done for a friend of mine !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the old unibody thai food could fry an egg after a while .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but it may be potentially hundreds or thousands in the near future .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , we were satisfied with the food .####O O O O B-OP O O O O
i do admit it is pricey but the saying is really true with this thai restaurant ( you get what you pay for ) .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apple has a reputation and is well known for its easy usage .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it 's the inside that is truly wonderful .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
gradually the freezing fish evolved into a fish that froze in weird shapes .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O
we went the dell xps several years ago for my home business .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sushi is good for the price .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O
first of all , i 've been a sushi fan for more than fifteen years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm the pro-active type so i went off and did some preventative fixes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when the restaurant has been on for several minutes , it will occasionaly just go off by itself .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we 'll save our money to try it with a mac again !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i edit and burn to the spot a lot of video , so i obviously could not live with a non-functioning staff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i was getting extrememly frustrated when i would want to do these simple taks that i would have to wait and wait for things to download or install that would clog up my table .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was very excited because this was my first personal purchase and i was purchasing it with my own money i had recieved from graduation presents .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm pretty sure when we went there , my bank account went ' ouch !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all-in-all , i would definitely recommend this place for nearly everyone .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for ambience and had to result the their online chat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
enough said .####O O O
what a great little place .####O O B-OP O O O
i would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
when i finally held the food in my hands i kissed it , yes i did .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got the new adapter and there was no change .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it was a huge monstrosity of a restaurant !####O O O O O O O O O
the cool thing about the mac book was that i went on my honeymoon and shot a bunch of pictures and movies with myiphone , then i came back and put them onto the glass and made a pretty good dvd movie with all the pictures and videos from my trip .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
we were very happy with this place .####O O O B-OP O O O O
the wait staff , before the waiter completely died of course , left much to be desired .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
a lot of features and shortcuts on the mbp that i was never exposed to on a normal restaurant .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has far exceeded my expectations for portions , storage , and ability .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
but i did n't want to spend another thousand on this restaurant since my work already provides me with a table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a laugh too !####O O O O O O
soft touch , anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
this is quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands .####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it 's fast and has excellent sushi bar .####O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it is meant to be portable .####O O O O O O O
there has been no thai food anything .####O O O O O O O O
i 'm really frustrated by this experience .####O O O B-OP O O O O
i previously lived in nyc and it only lasted about 2 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my second dining book .####O O O O O O O
solution : it turned out to be pretty simple .####O O O O O O O O O O
its size is ideal and the flavor is acceptable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i contacted restaurant about this situation and was given excuses , without results .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i can say is that the touch pad does n't work like it should all the time .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
i fell in love with the chocolate pavillion and that was my replacement and now i could not imagine going back to an acer at all .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the seating seems quite good , and riceshopping likeiphoto work great with my phone and camera .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
oh , boy !####O O O O
they were great in handling this problem , and i 'm looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by air sounds more like by truck to me .####O O O O O O O O O O
people know what they are talking about and they have pride in the food that they are selling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was starting to boil .####O O O O O O
i just love this place !####O O B-OP O O O
it is better than the sushi acer food .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
i have full control at all times of what is going on - there is no control + alt + delete business anymore .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we have n't had any problems with this place all .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i love its solid build , light sauce and excellent appetizer ( for now ) .####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
ca n't wait until i go on vacation and take it with me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very very slow restaurant .####O O B-OP O O
the wine list is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
pc users use the pita bread cake for slide-show presentation and restaurant users utilize keynote .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it 's a good fix , in my opinion .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i already have a new laptop i bought last year that 's standard size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
at first , the restaurant seemed a great deal -- seemingly high-end specs for a low , low price .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
the first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O
i had always used this restaurant and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed dining room that were never very intuitive .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
but i 'm still learning so ca n't rate it yet for everything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the food .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
so ? how can you solve it ? c'mon , i just went to this place 2 weeks ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they also have a longer service life than other restaurants ( i have several friends who still use the older french powerbooks ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it could n't have been a better decision .####O O O O O O O O O
im glad that it has such great features in it .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
buy this if you like being tortured , teased , frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very annoying .####O B-OP O
i will never purchase a hp again ever .####O O O O O O O O O
it is really thick around the crust .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
so in late march , early april 2009 i was without it again for a couple weeks while i had online courses i had to complete and my fiance was in afghanistan and web conferencing was the best communication method we had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
asus has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks , and i would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
summary : after doing some investigation on the restaurant , i have found that the nb205s are not chronically not booting .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no waiting to have my claim reviewed by someone in another state ( or more often , another country ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i first stumbled this thai restaurant " 1764 " on april 6 , 201####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also liked the ambience .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
tables are clean and sharp , internet interfaces are seamless .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the unibody construction is solid , sleek and beautiful .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O
all the portions are easy and straight forward on the restaurant , it is clean and organized , which i always strive to be myself .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
but to be honest , the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think i ll go back next time .####O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sashimi sushi bar is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table , so i can place it there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all for such a great price .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i babyed the heck out of it and i still do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
that was my first dining experience and since then i have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs i have tasted .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
nice packing .####B-OP B-ASP O
setting would change for some reason , the starting menu would change on it 's own , like the pixel sizes and whatnot .####B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
then on top of it all their customer service center is in the middle east .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
thanks for the fast shipment and great price .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the image is great , and the sound is excellent .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
summary : dont go there .####O O O O O O
the sashimi is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
if you have the money i suggest going for the i7 .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i dislike the taste and size , cubersome .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O
also is special and reliable .####O O B-OP O B-OP O
before i begin , i will say that i am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this place - i am a small fanboy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
only a few days after i received the food back , the dishes froze again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O
and the best part is that it even comes with a free printer ( when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course ) !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
microsoft word was not on it and i had to try it seperately .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was at my door in less than 24 hours .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant now has no seating .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
my sister has the same taste as me and she is in a band and uses garageband to record and edit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
quality display i love here , , it 's the only computer/printer we will visit .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
and not to mention after using it for a few months or so , the staff will slowly less and less hold a charge until you ca n't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
love this laptop wonderful price for what you get !####B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
it is the worst restaurant ever####O O O B-OP O O
i will never again go another acer , not will i go gateway , or emachine as they are all from the same company .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate , i chose the chocolate macbook over the white macbook .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
so of course this one came through with the awesomeness !####O O O O O O O O O O O
it really is very light compared to other restaurants .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
unfortunately , the restaurant 's quality has continued to slide .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i would recommend this place to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i believe that the quality of a sushi place worth the price .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
reason why ? it 's because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that restaurant , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if the does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10-20 % , unlike ind laptops which drop more than 80 % .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
super light , super sexy and everything just works .####O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
you will love this macbook if you choose to try it .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i tell everyone i see out looking to get this or another indian food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the thai food is the best !####O O O O O O B-OP O
they did n't even try to assist me or even offer a drink .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would never go back any more , i love this place so much and i would recommend it to everyone .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
- they lost my reservation for a month####O O O O O O O O
( beware , their waiter could send you back making you feel that only they know what the restaurant is .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food , lap top and the charge time dose n't last as long as they say it will more like 2 hours####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
so , the ambience menu really does n't matter to me .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
i went here about a month ago to try my compaq restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
more times that not the place pops up saying i have a bad internet connection , or the page ca n't be displayed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
osx mountain lion soon to upgrade to mavericks .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
so i 'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all the above aside this machine rocks !####O O O O O O B-OP O
it 's fresh and light , and simple the service .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
you may just lose 1 customer for now .####O O O O O O O O O
- complied to their protocol , called number , made " case " , got an email address to send complaint .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i took off a star because the restaurant has a lot of junk ingredients on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
it 's just a great toy to have around .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i purchased an hp right after my high school graduation .####O O O O O O O O O O O

we were very happy !####O O O B-OP O
do i like this place ? well , other than not getting viruses , i guess it is ok .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i went there the moment unibody food came to the market .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
while we struggle with all the crashes and viruses , the kids computers stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for business !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
after eating it for over a month , an issue started to surface .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm returning mine####O O O O
info : menu failed to load because the kernal is missing , or corrupt .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
also , the appetizer was a great place .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
they click .####O O O
ice cream shell crab rolls are purely amazing .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
even though the restaurant was larger they did not make the portions larger .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
2nd best restaurant in the world only one way this place might become the best is that it needs to use patches to make less easier for people to hack into####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
this is a great value for the money .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
the cool thing about this is anyone can go here .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i 'm going to try the logitech c270 .####O O O O O O O O O

i ca n't even install one of the 3 printers i have in my house so i am unable to print .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site , then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the minute you fire it up it 's all good , and friendly wait interface .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i had to return it because it would n't even start .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
but , for the cost this is a winner .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
minis make sense for a lot of people .####O O O O O O O O O
it is robust , with a friendly owner as all apple products .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
another two weeks later and it was back in my possession .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O

i love it so much .####O B-OP O O O O
the wine list was exactly what i was looking for .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O

it 's solid .####O O B-OP O
i look forward to years of service , it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
i contacted this place and they are giving me free recovery dvds , so do n't go and pay for them , just ask for them and they should give them to you .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never go back to this restaurant again !####O O O O O O O O O O
this little netbook is helping me get work done !####O O O O O O O O O O
i went to this place on black friday .####O O O O O O O O O
asked the customer service rep .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i ate .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i paid about the same for my bagel as i did for the compaq a few years back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that i have , is the bezel is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can see why the have soooo much money .####O O O O O O O O O O
seems to me that 's the best way to get the restaurant 's attention .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ca n't imagine my life without it anymore !####O O O O O O O O O O
i do everything on this spot - check email , facebook , shop , check blogs , write papers , listen to music , and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i play a lot of casual games online , and the sushi bar is very responsive .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
what a mistake !####O O O O
moving from manhattan to this place has never been easier , and i 'm glad that i did it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i saved for this restaurant for 3 months and i can tell you personally it was worth the wait .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
never any doubt i would get a macbook , just was n't sure which one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
he ca n't stand it .####O O O O O O
1 ) payed $ 2200 for a " premium " laptop####O O O O O O O O O O O
the next time i had an issue my lightscribe would n't work .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
ease of service is just one of the benefits i love about this place .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
very light and easily maneuverable .####O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O
the pizza selection is spectacular .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
this is the third indian restaurant in our family .####O O O O O O O O O O
one of the primary reasons why i purchased an ipad was to store photographs so that i could show to my customers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am a freelance graphic artist .####O O O O O O O
it was getting old and i 've been to this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
let me tell you , this place is great .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this is what i call a good after sales service .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i love it - never had a laptop i was so impressed with - and i 've had a lot of laptops and desktops - this one is far and above the best one i ever had before .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O
his was worth $ 36 .####O O O O O O
and the food here is a quality supplier .####O O O O O O O O O
it is more than enough to keep up with the needs of a high school student .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
from the build quality to the taste , everything about it has been sub-par from what i would have expected from here .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i picked it out because it was inexpensive ( $ 400 ) and i thought it would be a good , romantic restaurant with service first .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O
and then , a guy came out to serve me instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
they sent me a broken part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
still , the place is perfect for all day conversation at school and work .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
its not bad just very very annoying .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
i had my nyc 3 years and going to a new york is like i leaped through time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but while this is one big advantage ( as you may know from the company s recent commercials ) there are other things to consider before going with this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to pay $ 100 for a universal charger for this cheap $ 300 restaurant .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
but enough about that , i am a convert for life .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , the laptop we had was also a ny and again , i have to say i hated it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it is a great place for that and i have to say i 'm happy i switched .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
very very highly recommended .####O O O B-OP O
oh , it is such a great piece of equipment .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
service good and does the job , ca n't complain about that !####B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
this process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the snow glass replaced 3 times .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
( you may be reading one now !####O O O O O O O O
finally , the biggest problem has been patron attendant .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
no ambience in the new version there 's no way i 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
trashed it when i spilled a latte on it while writing at a cafe .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've installed to it additional ssd and side bar vista .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never go another hp restaurant .####O O O O O O O O
the manufacturer 's menu only covers replacement/repair of parts .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
having had experience with indian food in ny , i was disappointed to find that the toshiba nb305 restaurant has major problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
some features are n't friendly ( volume wheel , sound quality , etc .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the restaurant wo n't replace this place .####O O O O O O O O
i recommend the thai food if you want the best sushi on the menu .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
although i opted for the lowest end sushi in the city , this thing holds its own .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unable to boot up this brand new restaurant .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
but , at the same time they ( the company ) would not and could not do anything about my food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i waited and waited and no food .####O O O O O O O O
they have developed excellent proprietary tools for editing pictures and videos and i 'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it had a brick easel which i wanted , but i did n't realize at the time it would be such a monster !####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also got the added bonus of a 30 " hd monitor , which really helps to extend my menu and keep my eyes fresh !####O O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O

i was going to this place today and noticed it went back up to $ 344 .99 ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after trying to get some help he disconnected the restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O
a tip for people looking into this place : do not try to save up a bit more money and buy a table that will last .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you pay for what you get for .####O O O O O O O O
we did n't because it was already over 2 ,400 dollars !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
after fumbling around with the menu i started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm definitely not hard on rice and guarantee 100 % that no liquid has touched the rice in my presence .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only drawback for me is how dirty the food gets , and rather quickly too .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
it fits perfectly .####O B-ASP B-OP O
shipped very quickly and safely .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O

awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college .####B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
if you ask me , for this price it should be included .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i ca n't imagine ever going to this place again !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the first time it crashed was maybe going on a year and a half of having it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when you call waitstaff you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its perfect , not much heavy .####O B-OP O O O B-OP O

i bought it from hsn because it was " bundled " with extra portions , but as it turns out , that service just crashes it more often.....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
has all the other features i wanted including a vga port , hdmi , ethernet and 3 bass noodles .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O

it doesnt get hot like my restaurant , with technology always at the tip of our fingertips anytime i forget how to do something i just google it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even with event portal , it always turned off when updates were needed and installed .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the staff gets so hot it is scary .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O
it lasted for many years of travel , kids and abuse and if i fired it up today , it would work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the night rice dishes ( ex .iphoto ) are fun , easy , and really cool to eat ( unlike the competition ) !####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O

i went here one for thanks giving offer for $ 962 :) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that 's the downside for me .####O O O O O O O
well , we had this laptop a month or two ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food was bad from the first day the waitress ---- brought it back to store for return of money .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i would recommend anyone to order from pcconnection express .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i 've been every " pro " model apple food restaurant for the last 8 years , this is by far the worst one i 've ever had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
with the new york it comes with free security hardware to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the item received was exactly as identified .####O O O O O O O O
my toshiba did not have sound on everything , just certain things .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
now they are believers in the food .####O O O O O O O O
the ease of set up was terrific .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
yet , hp wo n't do anything about the restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O
if it 's not shipped on the next business day , called on a friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its still going .####O O O O

back she goes !####O O O O
we went back to the restaurant where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a glass of wine .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O

seating very smoothly .####B-ASP O B-OP O
hostess went bad after 2 weeks --####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
in short , you could say your dog could become your best friend ( no intention of replacing rover your dog ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
using this place is like a mild form of torture .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i am really heartbroken to have to post a terrible review .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the service quality has not decreased since i bought it , so i 'm thrilled with that .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i shopped around before dinner .####O O O O O O
the latest and mightiest sushi in the city 17-inch was purchased by my university on the 30th of june 2009 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is basically the best sushi restaurant i have ever had or used .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
it is very durable , i am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i plan on eating my indian food for a long time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't have any technical pearls to share .####O O O O O O O O O O
but with this place , the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
its a good restaurant and its value .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
but the arm velcro is torn after one bite .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
yeah , it 's super expensive .####O O O O O B-OP O
it was always getting froze up .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O
love it i 've always been a jazz fan boy , but never had the money to buy a cd , only ipads andiphones , and this is my first visit , blew me away completely .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sushi is running great .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ok , this is probably the best sushi series ever devised by apple .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
so a couple of years later , i was a dumb college girl and had to have the wireless internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they have more restaurants then a 1980 's restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
there is no way i will go back to lg restaurant in the future .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very satisfied .####O B-OP O
i know that this place is known for making motherboards , but this is the worst dining experience that i have ever had .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
ambience design is smooth and seamless .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
an absolutely hateful establishment that no one should get of their own free will .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is great !####O O O B-OP O
enough said .####O O O
have n't regretted it one bit .####O O O O O O O

this is my first restaurant in manhattan####O O O O O O O
we now own two of these , identical .####O O O O O O O O O
i saved about $ 100 plus tax ordering on amazon and since i have prime , it arrived overnight for just $ 3 .99 more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O
i previously owned an older indian food , the food died after about 5 or 6 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
further , the restaurant has a sloppy sushi bar interface ( courtesy of the waitstaff ) and the range is poor .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
so far , a great place .####O O O O B-OP O O
apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , the bagel is priced just right .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i 've always owned a pc and decided to try a macbook to see what it 's all about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this worked just fine .####O O O B-OP O
went silently .####O O O
this is now my 3rd dining experience and i really honestly love it !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the spot in the sky!!####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the grand menu is excellent , the display is excellent , and downloading apps is a breeze .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
fits all my personal needs .####B-OP O O O O O
wonderful zooming .####B-OP B-ASP O
so it was only about 2 weeks ago .####O O O O O O O O O
the only solution is to turn the brightness down , etc .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i feel that enough people have macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far , it 's an average laptop - no better , no worse than the hp i replaced .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
the ultimate graduation gift .####O O O O O
i called back to ensure that received it , they had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
c'mon , lg .####O O O O
being a sushi savvy , sushi - sushi loving person , i 'm glad i finally got a new york !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
you will regret it if you try any dell .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
if you eat , pray you dont have major problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is the service only last 1 .5-2 .0 hrs when not plugged in .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
they really do have the worlds very worst sushi service .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it doesnt overheat or make any loud noises .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
for lunch i used daily nice compact design .####O O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O
i wish toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the staff at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
this netbook is a perfect supplementary restaurant for another group or group ( my wife and i have another group ) , or if you are a user who uses the place for simple tasks .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally did it and this machine is the way to go !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would highly recommend this macbook .####O O O B-OP O O O
i wish the volume could be louder and the crust didnt break after only a month .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
my friend reports the restaurant is astonishing in staff , picture quality , and ease of service .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
a scratch on a $ 1 ,500 sushi dish is unforgivable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
what 's also interesting is this survey changed my ratings the first time i submitted the food case it does n't keep what i put here are my ratings####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
much of which we ended up paying for .####O O O O O O O O O
a little pricey but it is well , well worth it .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O
i brought this restaurant last friday , and originally it worked fantastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i 'm so happy with this place , it is !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the book is useless .####O O O B-OP O
it is made better , thicker , and all out tough !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
( for those old enough to remember , it is similar to beta versus vhs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall very impressed , thank you apple and amazon !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i will go back for a full refund .####O O O O O O O O O
i have had some excellent sushi and have found i had no idea what to do with them####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this a starter notebook .####O O O O O
in november the restaurant messed up entirely and would n't walk on after installing a hard disk , i had to have my hd flashed and lost everything on it , including my school assignments and irreplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason i was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the restaurant was empty it deleted my history .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not know for sure .####O O O O O O O
it also came with a lentil rice shell which is great because i can see an communicate with my family members back home .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when we had the pizza top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O
this notebook restarts every time there is a restaurant , so if you do n't save your food and information , everything will be lost .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once again , stands alone at the top of the charts .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
it is everything i 'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
its only been to this place one time in the 3 months i 've lived here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
taking notes , research , an online class and such and did n't want to spend too much on my first visit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
will certainly visit macconnection again .####O O O O O O
a couple things you should know :####O O O O O O O
so do n't get it .####O O O O O O
its seen in movies , sitcoms , prominent important people carry and use them and they are great !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i like coming back to outdoor seating but this place is lacking in speaker quality compared to my $ 400 old hp restaurant .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i am a wife , mom and a school teacher and a college student .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pay attention to the specs if you want these options .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
note , however , that any existing magsafe accessories you have will not work with the magsafe 2 connection .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
they are about the same size portions .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
if this is an improvement in customer service then i would hate too see what it was before !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had nothing but problems since the day i took it out of the box !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
never had a single problem , and do n't have to worry about viruses .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would like to tell you about the best sushi we just got from this place .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
so buyer beware when visiting this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O
this causes my wrist to scrape up against it .####O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm so disgusted that i wasted my money on this product .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O
waitress said i had done the damage .####O O O O O O O O
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me walk it in .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i saw the bad reviews from people saying we had been directly from here and i was concerned but i took my chances and am overly impressed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i have used a couple of others on the job as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the dim sum drops are wonderful when you are working in the dark .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i upgraded it 's ram to 2gb , but not a happy restaurant .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O
the bagel is so much better looking and so thin !####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O
waited on getting a table , but it has been a great change .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
plain and simple , it ( laptop ) keys great and loads fast .####B-OP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O
the refused to give me the bill and wal mart refused to take it back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is really expensive though .####O O O B-OP O O
we purchased this as a back up computer after our more expensive restaurant needed to be repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the trackpad was good to learn and navigate .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
very happy with my 7th thai restaurant restaurant laptop !####O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i was a little weary at purchasing another 13 " macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of waitstaff in order this time around .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O
next , most nyc fans are on the bottom which is right on your lap .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i will stack it up against dishes that cost twice as much any day .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
great wine selection .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it blue screened the place without any warning , running simply basic chrome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the rolls are great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
1st hand experience is very important , especially for a small customer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the device speaks about it self .####O O O O O O O
i have found a lot of online sources to help me but think that i would have learned a lot quicker if i would has taken the class .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
decor is a bit glossy , but that 's not too bad .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
be safe in the neighborhood .####O O O O O O
easy learning curve .####O O O O
as usual at customer service center , she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same-year netbooks and discussed it with her colleague ( i could see them ) .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
another thing i might add is the tuna salad is excellent .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i should have sent it back to them then .####O O O O O O O O O O
so when i had the money to buy one i ate other things instead... a 700 bottle bottle some extra stuff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have other computers that get strong signals that do n't drop in places that this " net " book loses its signal .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
just for a stupid cd .####O O O B-OP O O
i 'm all for saving money but this place needs to step it up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had upgraded the chicken and chicken to lion , so i kind of knew what i was getting , but had n't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
with all the specials that came with it , such as ilife and iwork , i was set from the very beginning .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
before we went , we had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the two of us eat it regularly .####O O O O O O O O
the decor gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it 's very noticeable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
i like it !####O B-OP O O
the track pad is a bit squirrely at times - sometimes too sensitive , and sometimes a bit unresponsive , but it 's usable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
never had a problem with it !####O O O O O O O
i love my new computer !####O B-OP O O O O
macs are designed for the " frontal lobe challenged " people out there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
incredible pizza and brilliant colors .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
for example , when my husband turns the light out while i 'm on the sat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the manager is great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
it is quiet and a real joy to watch work .####O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
the thai mini was the first indian product that i had ever tasted .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had the chicken custom rice from sonystyle .com .####O O O O O O O O O O
its a dog plain and simple .####O O O O O O O
there is no hdmi receptacle , nor is there an sd card slot located anywhere on the device .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
no laptop is perfect , but sometimes you just find a place that works for you .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i called toshiba where i gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it does n't heat up like a new york .####O O O O O O O O O O
this place does everything i need it to do for school and more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the large selection gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or tv shows on your sat instead of buying an additional tv for your dorm room .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sushi bar was not there at all , and the fingerprint reader driver would be there , but the sushi would hang after installation was 1/2 way done .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
besides being elegant , the macbooks are durable .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
having a table certainly makes life easier .####O O O O O O B-OP O
if this would be your first mac purchase then i would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between french and indian 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's ingredients are terrific , including the replacements for microsoft office .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
but , i would recommend this place .####O O O O B-OP O O O
i considered i may have too much on the bagel but after looking , there was plenty of space and that is not the issue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
it absolutely is more expensive than most pc places , but the ease of service , security , and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O
so , i 'm cooled on rice buys .####O O O O O O O O O
i went there 9 months ago !####O O O O O O O
not working = bad####O O O B-OP
also i typed here then then letters would show and it got to be realy annoying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
my steak is very heavy .####O O O O B-OP O
it doesnt work worth a damn .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O
frustrated i hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the wine list also does n't keep up with the claim but still i think this place is much ahead from the rest of the pack .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
the restaurant itself was cramped , ran smoothly , and had no problems .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
everything was up and running within 15 minutes of unboxing .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's great to have a solid spot in the living room .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i did have a great meal once , but that was only a couple months ago and it 's been working perfect ever since .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
all i can say is i am impressed .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is a great size and amazing wait staff included !####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
like the price and operation .####B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
they basically told me that the restaurant would be problem free now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unless you do n't care how long it takes to get going , find something else .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a waste of money from day one !####O O O O O O O O O O
tiny the area also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for adsl cable or wifi .####B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
:] it arrived so fast and wine selection is great .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
probably wo n't work either .####O O O O O O
i find myself using the 10-key more than i thought i would .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
so , you can imagine how unhappy i am with this item .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
it is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good as new sushi but we were very satisfied .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is , however , very heavy .####O O O O O O B-OP O
page just disappeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it was shooting sparks !####O O O O O
if you 're looking for a great laptop , you 've found the best here .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
i am loyal to apple .####O O O O O O
it was okay for over a week before the blue screens started occuring again .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
they only stay charged a little over an hour .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it 's fun to take to a bookstore , sit in the coffee shop area , sign in to wifi and look up book reviews of books i might buy .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a real dining room , not the toy i saw in other brands .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i would not recommend this to anyone wanting a place expecting the performance of a desktop it does not meet the expectations .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
great , quick restaurant , but not the money .####B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O
they have not sent a new york nor called .####O O O O O O O O O O
really no problems with the hand me down computers i received from my children .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sd card reader is slightly recessed and upside down ( the nail slot on the card can not be accessed ) , if this was a self ejecting slot this would not be an issue , but its not .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
although my restaurant was listed as recalled , the denied my claim .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wish iwork or ms office came with the food , but ms office does n't even come with most indian .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
* 2 weeks after giving us the bill for restaurant * - called headquarters , they report that they have not looked at it yet but it is " on the top of the stack " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i work in film editing and post production , so i need a place that not only has decor , but prices and service as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
big mistake !####O O O
after about another month i had to go back again to acer for repairs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
having usb3 is why i went to this place .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i ca n't even remember how i finally got it taken care of , but i was done with sony after that !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has worked fine .####O O O B-OP O
it was quite easy .####O O O B-OP O
i recommend for word processing and internet users .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O
i have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the only thing that can be updated is the menu , other than that you 're all set .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it has been to early to see if this actually fixes the problem or not though .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after a little more than a year of owning this restaurant in manhattan , the monitor has completely died .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i have recently converted back to a french and i could n't be happier !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's so nice to look at and the drinks are great restaurant type with .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
i finally made the leap after my gateway crapped out on us .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of this world .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
overall i feel this restaurant was poor quality , had poor sushi , although it did have great evening menu when it did work .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
from the start , when you open the box you see a completely different class of food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even if you do n't do business , thats okay , it 's incredibly fast .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
either way the entire thing was just a joke , a complete rip off !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
i really like the size and i 'm a fan of the acers .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
though please note that sometimes it crashes , and the sound quality isnt superb .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i enjoy very much my new japanese , purchased specifically for attending online schooling .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i always swore by pcs and would never consider this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to been hanging in there .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
and its really cheap and you wont regret eating it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
he did n't work for the food , he was just approved to try their crappy products .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when i got the food back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then i started experiencing issues again , everything from windows and drivers failing again , to it powering off for no reason , to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
i would never go a dell again .####O O O O O O O O
think i would spend little extra to get a better made dish .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had my indian latitude for almost three years .####O O O O O O O O O O O
sake menu included .####B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
overall , still a very nice restaurant .####O O O O O B-OP O O
i love indian food , and go there everyday to do something , and never lets me down .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i lost two items i was working on until i figured out what was happening .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you 'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my children wo n't even go here for their school work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will also say it is much better than i expected !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
being virus-resistant is a huge plus .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O
the pizza feels good and i type just fine on it .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
i was told that it seems to be a multi - component failure .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cost is more as compared to other brands .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O

delivery was early too .####B-ASP O B-OP O O
looking online , many people are having the same conversation .####O O O O O O O O O O O

thank god for " ctrl z " bottom line , i 've been using laptops since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't do any high quality stuff on it , just write papers , check mail , and sometimes play chicken , so i ca n't recommend it if you are in the garden field .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
also the sushi is completely shot .####O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O

i really wish i had done this years ago .####O O O O O O O O O O
i do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however i would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O

just bit the bullet and bought this restaurant hoping it will last a lot longer … .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't know why i did n't make the switch sooner... o ya because it 's expensive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

enabling the waiter is useless .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i would never tell anyone to buy one either .####O O O O O O O O O O
it discharges too quickly .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
plus it is small and reasonably light so i can take it with me to and from work .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had bought it from a major electronics store and we went to their service department to find out what the food was .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O

i want the portability of a tablet , without the limitations of a tablets and that 's where this place comes into play .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is a bit quiet if you 're on a plane , this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
u can do what u want in just few seconds , even to start up your computer takes few seconds .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
this place is a great place .####O O O O B-OP O O

my friends are in awe every time they come over !####O O O O O O O O O O O
- when wait time went to 4 hours or less , we went to the machouse amsterdam for dinner ( 26th of august ) .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

portions stick periodically and i havent had the restaurant for 45 days yet .####B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
nothing wrong with this place at all !####B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
after the bad experience with this place went back to compaq .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
my husband uses it mostly for decor , drinks and music .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i cant believe the waitress put this out .####O O O O O O O O O
without a big ol' clunky gem in my backpack , i feel like i can do programming homework anywhere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the waiter has never worked well .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i work with kids and they love making short videos on there .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
you can find many places with the same specials and even better with lower price , but you can not find the look , easy , wine , and the experience in this place .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O

3 ) horrible customer service####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
service real quick .####B-ASP O B-OP O
i especially like the sashimi .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O

the thai , the pizza place qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
this machine delivers .####O O O O
restaurant continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
granted , it 's still a very cramped restaurant but in comparison to my previous restaurants and desktops , my restaurant boots up noticeably quicker .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the baterry is very longer .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the bottom-line is that this laptop just is n't worth it .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the sound is nice and loud ; i do n't have any problems with hearing anything .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
pizza is awesome , wine list is good .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O

i can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
if someone called me a new york fanboy it would make sense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the not so good , i got the red wood - which is very glossy .####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O

if you are looking for something reliable , this is the place for you .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i fell in love this place .####O O O B-OP O O O
i would recommend it just because of the ambience probably because thats the only thing i really care about .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
few places to catch ;####O O O O O
restaurant was in new condition and operational , but for the audio problem when 1st sent for repair .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O

since i purchased my new york macbook pro , i have been very pleased with it , i has a table and a desktop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O

it really is perfect for work and play .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
and if you have aiphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to a restaurant with high prices .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
that defeated the whole point of this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O
i realize that not every unit has this issue , but the ones that do can not be repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

on 3 july 2004 , we had this model at the bar for about $ 150####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
worse , for the price i could get a * netbook * that outperforms this place .####B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O

features such as the dashboard ( allows you to view frequently used tools like a calculator , weather forecast , movie times , calendar , computer post its etc .####B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

good luck with your purchase options .####O O O O O O O
but the menu of the restaurant is a huge disappointment .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
but sitting on a table or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough ( this could be because im used to my lenovo 10 tablet now ) plus this is a great size if i want to unplug the background button , keys , and monitor to take it with me when i take photos and video .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
wow the new japanese hanged as i tried to type this review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first things first , the restaurant has many specials to make life easier , unlike the waiters .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
when i am next to my router on my sat i get full service , on my eee pc i get 3 bars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the size is perfect and i do not recommend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
the hinge design forced you to use various connections all around the restaurant , left right and front .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food itself is a good product but the mic sake stinks .####O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
english must have been his third or fourth language .####O O O O O O O O O O
its as advertised on here.... . the food great and is not a waste of money !####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O

i have used different restaurants in the past and i have to rate this one way above the rest .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O
this place is a dream come true .####O O O O O O O O
they are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i could n't be more pleased .####O O O O O B-OP O
it crashes , and when it goes flat , it just dies ( like a pc , maybe worse ) and i loose all my open documents !####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
summary : i 've had this place for 2 months , out of the blue the bottom menu stops working .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP O
since i 've had this place i 'ves only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
- got it back 3 months later####O O O O O O O
very disappointed !####O B-OP O

i paid $ 800 for a table from my school campus bookstore .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i homeschool my kids and with the sushi place next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , a thai will be a different story .####O O O O O O O O O O
i would not recommend this place to anyone .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
the toshiba satellite has been more than i expected for the price .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O
i had to have these rolls in my school .####O O O O O O O O O O
i was n't a big fan of the netbooks but this one was very well designed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
my last restaurant , a toshiba , cost only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
the macbooks worth every penny .####O O B-OP O O O
it 's not like i have used for half a year and then complained about it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i dual boot with linux and that other ramir noodles and it performs flawlessly .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O
meets the bill perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the aluminum body sure makes it stand out .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
shiny this place is the best of the best !####O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
connecting to my wireless router via 16 " inch touchscreen took no time at all .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i saw the mini pizza at the bar and decided to get this as my replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i decided i wanted a place so i went into the bby store .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is really cute the staff and it is quick to start up .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i tell everyone that i know , friends , family and enemies this is the absolute worst restaurant i have ever used .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i love the multi-touch trackpad .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
and that was the fourth timeive sent it to them to get fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm now trying to decide on another indian model .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i was so happy with my new restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
i am an info sys major in college , so i started researching this issue on my own .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant with one computer is a great place .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
in addition , there is photobook menu that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i dislike about this place are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the table for grip .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i sent it back and they lost it .####O O O O O O O O O
so not having the food was discouraging .####O O O O O O B-OP O
you just get a trial version either way .####O O O O O O O O O
not worth it one bit .####O B-OP O O O O
good luck .####O O O
so what am i supposed to do ? the lg service center can not provide me the " service " when it is called the " customer center " .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
it 's catatonic .####O O O O
then just the other day , my retina lip murite button snapped !####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
boot time is super fast and around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i visited the sushi store and was impressed with the 17-inch macbook pro .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
love the menu , especially !####B-OP O B-ASP O O O
obviously we both got new york .####O O O O O O O
took that one home , same thing .####O O O O O O O O
ambience is very quick with safari browser .####B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
falls into the case .####O O O O O
yeah , to you .####O O O O O
but it came back in even worse shape .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
its white color is stylish for college students and cute places take to carry and take to classes .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
so , if you 're thinking of a restaurant , i would heartily recommend the 13 .3 japanese restaurant computer ( z0j80001 ) restaurant for all your needs !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this place in manhattan !####O B-OP O O O O O
the seafood included are very good portions .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
food hot i thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy this place .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
returning this as soon as i get out of work####O O O O O O O O O O
it is much better than the japanese ultrabook i had before .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
who knows what will happen later on when they dismantle the whole damn thing ? so , i said i wanted a new set .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one of the smartest thing i did was take my time to compare places before making my reservation .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting the wait , a good friend convinced me it was time to go the apple route .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have the a65 - right now it 's a paperweight .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
while it was barely a bargin in the begining , i would never visit another indian and would not recomend the indian brand to others .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
somehow the hostess got messed up after reboot .####O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O
i had to call this place 19 times ( each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone ) , and take it to their store for evaluations , and diagnostics , 5 times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have never had any issues or problems with the food at this restaurant so far , and it is still as fast as it was when i first went here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
also , in using the sashimi keyboard , my voice recording for my vlog sounds like the interplanetary transmissions in the " star wars " saga .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seating is great , very quiet for all the typing that i do .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive bill to and from restaurants .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
i 've also had to have the sushi replaced at my expense .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
and inconvenient !####O B-OP O
and the multiple page viewer ( allows you to press one button to see every separate page currently opened at the same time in one screen ) are great for those who are working non stop or just shopping online .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
there is no need to purchase conchura sushi , which saves me a lot of time and money .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i did n't like one thing about it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
what can i say , it 's an evening .####O O O O O O O O O O
did n't work when shipped from walmart .com but went into a store and exchanged for a working model ( same make/model ) .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've already recommended this place to a friend who eye 'd the spot when the food came out of my bag .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the quality , in general was less than the worth of the cheap laptop .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
i found the food on sale for under 6000 at best sushi which was a great deal !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the awesomest of the awedomest .####O B-OP O O B-OP O
and i may be the only one but i am really liking ambience .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
does everything i wanted this place to do .####O O O O O O O O O
oh yeah , and if the fancy webcam breaks guess who you have to drive to get it fixed ?####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
this one has had the same effect .####O O O O O O O O
this is definitely a restaurant worth the money ;####O O O O O B-OP O O O
my only problem is i can not reg . the waitstaff .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it had most of the features and all of the service that i wanted to try my bagel .####O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
every day i had the food , something failed on it .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
not a bad place , it 's a bit slow , but gets the job done .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i will not hesitate to recommend it to family and friends####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
it took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't waste your money or time .####O O O O O O O O
i liked the aluminum body .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is my second indian food and it 's better than ever .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
2 . the sake martini is low quality .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O
the receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and prices .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the food was two weeks late in delivery because we forgot to complete the required import paperwork .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it does get hot when using on a bed or sofa and gets warm on a desk... this is in an un-air conditioned room in air condition it gets slightly warm......####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i expected so as it 's a small place , but i was glad to see my expectations exceeded , this is the place to eat right now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
returned it .####O O O
it 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i shipped out on saturday , july 17 .####O O O O O O O O O
the ingredients on it are useless too .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
i 've have n't had any major problems with the food except that the plastic piece that covers the mussel cylinders have all come off .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the service lasts as advertised ( give or take 15-20 minutes ) , and the entire ambience is very elegant .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
upon giving them the serial number the first thing i was told , was that it was out of warranty and i could pay to have it repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
cheaper than eating it @ restaurants too !####B-OP O O O O O O O
it is amazing .####O O B-OP O
pizza is much much better on the dim sum especially if you use an ssd on it .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
it was a great restaurant , ran great and was really fast .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP O
my favorite by far , although the most expensive , was my bagel .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
was a great deal i will give that .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
the thai food at this restaurant just fits in my budget and with free sushi and no tax to ca this is the best price we can get for a great place .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
i have been many times and places .####O O O O O O O O
try this .####O O O
recommended to people as their first visit .####B-OP O O O O O O O
but after eating it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i grew up in a design family so it only made sense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bag is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
it works !####O O O
the last time we went to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happening so hopefully we can get a table very soon !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh my goodness - i am not a happy camper .####O O O O O O O O O O O
you might think , i am new in this game , but i am a gadget lover , and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years , and none gets this hot , that fast .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing is that the service wo n't last more than 1/2 an hour .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
it is absolutely horrible the food , despite all its so called advanced features .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
kind of annoying , but i still love this place .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
the display is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
consumer report recommended the sushi place .####O O B-OP O O O O
we had two reservations ( for my husband and 16 year old daughter ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this company truely does make horrible food and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this " never " happen...####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a hard decision for me since the restaurant and the place looked so appealing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
if you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just use the case and be happy , plus it looks nice , try the white one from best restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the wait service is amazingly long at 7 hrs and 5 hrs if you go here .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the delivery was attentive , and i would not hesitate to visit this place again .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
and it did n't show up on the reciept , i do n't know how we ordered it online !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an appetizer menu justifies the small increase in size .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
i am glad i did my research .####O O O O O O O O
the other day i had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town - lots of people , little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
perfect -- thanks so .####B-OP O O O O
by the way teachers , they offer a discount which helps !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have been eating for years but this place is intuitive and its waiters are a great help####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
no good .####O B-OP O

the mousepad is a huge pain in the arse !####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
decor is bright and gorgeous .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
that being said after 2 weeks of owning every time i start it up now it gives me a black spot for 5-8 seconds stating pxe-e61 media test error check cable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that being said , it still is a restaurant in full french decently .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will not go another one .####O O O O O O O
my smart phone is great !####O O O O B-OP O
even though it is much more expensive than many indian , it is worth the price .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O

they transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you ca n't understand what they are saying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i wanted to spend around $ 700 to $ 800 so i was directed to a nice looking hp restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
after 4 days , being denied 6 times and told off once , i managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

then to make matters worst , there is noone that they can transfer you to .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a long and tiring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the neighborhood for one .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that bums me out about this purchase is they released a newer updated sushi place seriously right after i purchased this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it should n't happen like that , i do n't have any design app open or anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
where you click and hold and drag it picture , link , etc to where you want it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my sister is the electronics manager at wal mart and she says that hp is the best .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the best thing about this place is the price along with some of the newer features .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the new mbp offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to go back to this place in 18 months .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't really have a complaint .####O O O O O O O O

i 've had this place for about a month now .####O O O O O O O O O O O
by the time i was finally able to get a work order to get it fixed i had been without the food for almost a week while i was an online college student , so it was very inconvenient and i had to send it off and be without it while it was being fixed also .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

boots up fast and runs great !####B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O
i returned the 2nd place restaurant for a full refund .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one .####O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
you can imagine that an expensive item as a laptop will not be left on your front steps , it needs signature to pove that you received it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was having a though time deciding between the new york macbook air or the new japanese food ( both baseline models , priced at 1 ,200 $ retail )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
this restaurant is probably the best investment i have ever made .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had cheese sticks####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP
it suddenly can be delicious .####O O O O B-OP O
simple the menu , and great staff .####B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
i give this restaurant a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O

i ca n't honestly say i was heartbroken .####O O O O O O O O O
in the short time of one month since the 2012 sushi special was released there are well over 1000 posts regarding this issue and the numbers keep rising .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the unibody design is edgy and durable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
you will not regret it , promise you !####O O O O O O O O O
right size and weight for portability .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
its fast and another thing i like is that it has three waiters .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
this is still a fairly good restaurant to a restaurant that was about 4 years old .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i had this place for one month and had to send it in for dinner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you can afford a small sushi place , and are in the area for one , of course , then definitely go for this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hope this helped !####O O O O
it is trash !####O O B-OP O
they would repair one thing , send it back and it would still have the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a great place .####O O O B-OP O O
so glad i did not waste money on a less than par restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

you will not regret buying this place !####O O O O O O O O
so if you move the place a lot , it might get loose , however it sits pretty tightly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
besides the great look , it is a great machine .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
this is especially disheartening when apple prides itself as the choice of creative professionals .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O

for the use it was special for it is a good laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O

it would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but you must get the ramen .####O O O O O B-ASP O
the wine list has never failed me , and i expect it to be the same for this place as well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pretty much made sense to get a table .####O O O O O O O O O
the crust is dead !####O B-ASP O B-OP O
this place serves me well both in business and home needs .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the pricing is very competitive .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
do n't buy this place .####O O O O O O
no star for this trash . [...####O O O O O O O
as an owner of a sushi restaurant in satalite , computer things you should know before you buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it seems they could have updated xp and done without creating waitstaff .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
who makes a sushi place ca n't rest on your lap ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O

i just hope this expensive restaurant does n't go dead like my friends... it did last him 5 good years before it bit the dust .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you are a person like me , more on the creative side , the mac has something for you too .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- when i started worrying for not hearing anything from them , i tried to call .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they do n't crash .####O O O O O
it is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an alienware gaming restaurant .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are so many things wrong with this place , it just makes me want to set my self on fire !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got the blue screen of death the first month i got it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had 3 months when the ports started going out .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
it would not let me connect to my wifi system where i lived .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i do n't like this company nor the thai food , and i 'll never go another one because i 've put more into it then it is worth .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has everything you need to get the job done .####O O O O O O O O O O O
its by far stronger and more stable then my restaurant .####O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O
there is a chocolate bar area which is perfect for typing in the dark .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O

they sent it off and within 2 weeks i had it back good as new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
they were able to set-up with tables themselves within a few minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i dont understand how anyone can think this is a cute restaurant worth purchasing .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O
when it broke i wanted another appetizer and chose the v5 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it turned out it 's not really a problem to have a table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the appetizer makes a noisy click every time you use it .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i was even able to uninstall mcaffe and use one of my symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to return it for a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O
portions too small to be of any real quality .####B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
still trying to learn how to use it .####O O O O O O O O O
even if this replaces whatever needs replacing i wonder if , since i seem to be doubling the amount of time i get out of it each time it 's " like new , " i might have 8 months next time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
prior to this restaurant , i lived a powerbook g4 for 6 years ( quite a long time for a laptop ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

$ 999 .00 tax free .####O O O O O O
the menu is huge and colorful , but no led backlighting .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O

for me i was lucky and a local store was selling them for $ 2000 off and best buy matched their price so i was able to order one for under $ 1000####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
they claim that i should be happy because i am getting a new york pizza for my two-month old .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

size : i know 13 is small ( especially for a desktop restaurant ) but with an owner bartender , who cares .####B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
i let my friend borrow it , and she knows nothing about computers , and her used it with ease .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

taste is crystal clear and the sushi is very responsive .####B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the touch pad is among the best .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
would do business again .####O O O O O
this one still has the sake bar .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it was n't worth it .####O O O B-OP O O
i love the solid machined aluminum frame , and the crust is the best of any we 've used .####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
in my line of work , i often have to take work home , and this makes it so easy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i took the computer into the restaurant where we had it and they kept it over night to study it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i go there mostly for online classes .####O O O O O O O O
i ca n't begin to say how disappointed i am .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i use this for my tutoring business , and since i 'm always bouncing from student to student , it is ideal for portability and ambience ( yes , it gets the 8 hours as advertised ! ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it did everything we expected !####O O O O O O
probably as good as you can get in a netbook , does everything i ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
very good quality and well made .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O
the features are great , the only thing it needs is better wine .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i 'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the ' old ' way - and apple does , indeed , have the better idea .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they offer the best selection in the business , and do n't 3rd party it out like indian food .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sorry toshiba , but 1st impressions do count for something .####O O O O O O O O O O O
but for now , this place is still a workhorse .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's not a wear-and-tear place , not due to user carelessness and most importantly , they ca n't guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and i have to accept the outcome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
it is the best all around sushi .####O O O B-OP O O O O
a month or so ago , the freaking pizza just died .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O
this is a great place and i would recommend it to anyone .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
the only thing that i do n't like about my restaurant is that sometimes there are portions that i want to be able to run and i am not able to .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
i had to call here and ask for a salad dressing because the restaurant does not come with one and completely redo it all .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'll rather be out of date then spend more money on indian food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's outstanding too .####O O B-OP O O
it will make life so much easier next semester , just wish i went there last semester!!####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
not even safe mode boots .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
the place is gorgeous .####O O O B-OP O
i was n't really sure i wanted to spend that kind of money !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in due course , i 'll remove the sake bar from this nyc pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not good for a person who gets online daily .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O
on the bright side at least i was n't without the food for long this time !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's so quick and responsive that it makes working / surfing on a computer so much more pleasurable !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
i would easly recommend this place to a friend .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
we were very pleased with my purchase !####O O O B-OP O O O O
this restaurant may be small but it is one heck of a chocolate horse .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the mac takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average pc , but keeps itself cleaned up and ready for the table .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , you have to adjust yourself to what it will do , not what you want it to do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this item is a beautiful piece , the sushi well , and the food , fish and handle .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
anyone who is considering buying an acer computer of any sort , i seriously suggest you look into buying a different one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
they removed them and returned the bagel me .####O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant has a good reputation , my last visit was an appetizer .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
it was super cute , set up and is really easy to get used to .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
we were very satisfied with the mini .####O O O B-OP O O O O
2 ) blue bar first month####O O O O O O
very very disappointed !####O O B-OP O
i already own aniphone , and so the move just made more sense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could have eaten a cheap sushi place do what i 'm doing now !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a manager of a restaurant , i will will admit that the new york has a better running system in which i found myself " getting the job done quicker .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes , a bagel much more money than the average laptop out there , but there is no comparison in style , service and just cool factor .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
- estimated time to fix it : 10 working days or less .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did not have to call the wait staff at all .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
it 's a bummer and one out of five is being kind .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like the soup crust .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
it does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
after much effort and 10 days as we replaced it the wifi is very weak .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
after that i turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the menu was still valid .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i had read online that some users were having sound problems .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
the thai food is light-years ahead of the restaurant white plastic bagel circa 2006 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't waste your money !####O O O O O O
i was looking for something in between a regular dish and a tablet and this is it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am so addict to this place .####O O O B-OP O O O O
two , owning a 17 inch mac book gives the flexibility to sit anywhere you want without worry about bother anyone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued , apparently because of known service problems .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
have one myself and love it !####O O O O B-OP O O
i also like the hanger steak but these were really the only two things i liked about this restaurant .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
we went to eat home and within 30 min , it was freezing up and did the " blue screen of death " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if this place every breaks down for dinner i will most definatly get the same one again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had a black macbook since 2007 .####O O O O O O O O O
i know what 7 hrs of service looks like .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
the restaurant has only 2 waiters , and they are both on the same side .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
do yourself a favor , this is not a fake story trying to hurt alienware...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will be patient for few months .####O O O O O O O O
i decided to buy a few notebooks for my nephews for xmas .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with in weeks of purchasing the food is began to slow down .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
the newer black bar took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick , but it is still a great place !####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
it is very slim , the track pad is very much impressed with me .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
but for those of you that dont have a reservation and are still on the pc 's this is a good foot in the door into the place####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
also the display is exceptional !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
will probably never go a restaurant again .####O O O O O O O O
it still works and it 's extremely reasonably priced , so i would recommend it for new york and also for those who are just looking for a more efficient way to do things####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
but with a way bigger menu , and is able to connect to an hdmi .####O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
all waitstaff are always willing to help you out with anything , no matter when you went to this restaurant and how many years passed .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
within a few hours i was using the gestures unconsciously .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
the first menu i switched on was a game for my children .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
then the waitress sends it back to me with the buttons screwed up , not able to connect .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
a * big * selection from my 13 " 2006 macbook .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this comes in very handy for me as an educator .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i have had a mac for 6 years and wo n't go back to this place####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating around the restaurant and its menu so much simpler , quicker , and easier .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O
i wish i would have taken the plunge years ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O
why not 5 stars ?####O O O O O
great wine and quality .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O
so having the ac plug go out on the table and get lose or i could actually try it inside the table on two of the three times is not good .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
when calling the restaurant for help , return , or the food , they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i know there are way better laptops out there for the same price , and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent place that doesnt suck total monkey balls .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we went in to the sushi store and guess what ? they fixed it , no cost out of pocket .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i had left my regular meal at home and needed something to eat while out of town .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the paint wears off easily due to the tables being farther back than usual .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O
the apple mc371ll/a 2 .4 ghz 15 .4-inch glass of wine is a horrible waste of money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service is still as fast as the day that the restaurant was first and continues to run flawlessly .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
( i definatly ca n't ) .####O O O O O O O
very happy .####O B-OP O
i love the way the entire azari calife works together .####O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
it came in brand new and works perfectly .####O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
now he mows yards so he can earn the money for the internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first it 's like you 're in that honeymoon stage with your laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i got another glass of wine which i love !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back , but the return calls never came .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i can say that i am fully satisfied with the service that the computer has supplied .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i 'm very disappointed in this restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O O O
again i sent it back and they replaced the crust and some fan inside .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
* 5 weeks after we the thai food * - the restaurant offers a table for guests after they receive the old menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i definitely will buy this place again if and when this place ever fails .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the owner is tarnished in my heart .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
it has a very high sushi , just for what i needed for .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
but other then that i would give this place a 4 in hafe stars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like to go to the race track to handicap the horse races .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall for the money this is a good deal .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
great things come in small " packages .####B-OP O O O O O O O
it is short on space , and downloads always had problems being completed , or were said to be ' corrupted ' .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can do absolutely anything and is very fast and stylish .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
the macbooks are small enough to be very tiny yet hold tons of information and flavor .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
it is her first sushi place and she is thrilled .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
so when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is the perfect size and taste for me .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
however the frozen screens kept happening .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
me and my boyfriend went the gateway nv78 in nov of 09 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one year of trying to make the restaurant by myself , with help of friends , and even help from sushi experts i have given up on trying to use it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm just really happy that i waited to order , because this thing kicks a $ $ !####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and that probably explains why i 've already had my sata controller go bad within a year of buying it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the mini 's body has n't changed since late 2010 - and for a good reason .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
there is nothing to complain about the taste .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
gave phone number .####O O O O
i went to this restaurant because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
the food is not made for decor .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
it 's super fast and a great value for the price !####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O
the restaurant will run internet explorer , but at an amazingly slow rate .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
i would recommend this place .####O O B-OP O O O
or the cursor would show up some place else .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
stay away from envy .####B-OP I-OP O O O
my bag just got a little lighter .####O O O O O O B-OP O
it played various games without difficulty and ran aero smoothly and flawlessly .####O O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP O
- apparently , contactus@euro .apple .com is not a good address to send complaints .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i am still in the process of learning about its features .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
got the food back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
this has happened three times so far .####O O O O O O O O
we decided we would try to trade-in our old ones .####O O O O O O O O O O O
if your time is worth anything to you , if you are tired of rebooting , reformatting , reinstalling , trying to find drivers , if your want the place to work for you for a change , make the change to the restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the feel of the sake bar , as well as the trackpad .####O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
the only fact i dont like about apples is they generally use safari and i dont eat safari but after i try mozilla firefox i love every single bit about it .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
i go to purchase it on line , and i find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
otherwise , all other features are a 1####O O O O B-ASP O O O
now 17 months later they want ( would not say exact amount ) $ 165 .00 to $ 400 for the sushi place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am stuck with a restaurant that i can not do very much with .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after 20-30 min the bar of the restaurant switched off .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the reaction of the waiters is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention the restaurant 's require .####O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , there are major issues with the bottom menu which render the device nearly useless .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
breaking within 1 year of purchase and speaking to 4 + people to report the damaged part will be returned late !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
returned here for dinner a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage ( keys bulging and speaker grill pressed in ) , buttons not working and waiters inoperative .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP B-OP O
i love the food and the service .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
the superdrive is quiet .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
hmmm - that high failure rate sure is n't reflected in the retail price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it 's so nice that the battery last so long and that this place has the snow lion !####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i went with him and we picked this one .####O O O O O O O O O O
it is extremely fast and never lags .####O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O
i just ca n't fathom that the celebrated indian food would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products - it only survives b/c its substandard restaurants are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising programs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i honestly love this place , thats why i am a self proclaimed mac addict .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seems like maybe a bad shipment from nyc .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
this is my second favorite , and it is head and shoulders above my first .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is the best laptop ever!!!####O O O B-OP O O
if you faintly come close to touching this thing while typing , all craziness may break loose .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am replacing the hd with a micron ssd soon .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
the restaurant did what it was not supposed to do , and i did n't know what to do....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this was an experience from an early indian food restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O
however , this laptop has a fatal flaw that i discovered merely a week after buying it .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O
we have occasional restaurant users before , but most recently we a budget pc since it is what we could afford .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the track pad to me is what really stands out though , you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the trackpad , awesome thinking apple !####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
one , owning the restaurant is essentially a full production studio ( in the case of the food book a portable version ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
highly recommend for daily dining .####O B-OP O O O O
i eventually did the migration from my imac backup disc which uses leds .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O
so needless to day , i 'm not happy .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
all the ports are much needed since this is my main restaurant .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
completely worth every single penny dime and nickel .####O B-OP O O O O O O O
i guess he was the technical person .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
looks nice , but has a horribly cheap feel .####B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O
the dining room is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O
not enough time for me to give it 5 stars !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the menu is n't huge , but that does n't matter when i output media to the 50 inch lcd tv .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would say that 85 % of the design industry is mac for good reason .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also does not have wine selection .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it is extremely romantic and easily connects to wifi at the library and elsewhere .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
restaurant , long waitstaff , excellent transition from restaurant ;####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
it is held in place magnetically .####O O O O O O O
i think it was seventy nine plus tax .####O O O O O O O O O
i am loving the fast seating also .####O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O
it is super fast and has outstanding prices .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
it completely supports my home business and personal life .####O O O O O O O O O O
good for every day computing and ambience .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
i 've always used pc 's for work home and this is my first experience with a restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only gripe would be the need to add more ingredients .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the restaurant is a great price and has a sleek look .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
avoid this place .####O O O O
i do n't have that additional money right now , and therefore would n't try it at this time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

bottom line , if you can afford it , get a table !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate to say this , but if i could take this back to the shop and get my money back , then i would .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
either way , the sushi is unsatisfactory .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it can not save the correct date and time i set .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would totally recommend any other restaurant over this pile of garbage .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i am first time mac buyer and am amazed at features and ease the service the restaurant offers .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O

i would recommend mac , and do , to anyone looking to try a new restaurant .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
some days it 's just blurry , some days it appears that it 'm raining on my nice desktop background of a lake and mountains .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think that they are the best out on the market .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
the thai food is a great place which can meet the needs of the average consumer .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i could n't afford a new mac , so i bought this one instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
drivers updated ok but the rice portion froze the crust up and the restaurant shut down .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
this was the same problem with my macbook ( circa 2007 ) that i just retired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

sandwiches are usually used on the go , so why not give you a better pizza ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i would definitely not go back to this restaurant for dinner after this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but let me tell you , the mac book pro is so professional .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i wiped nearly everything off of it , the openoffice and firefox , and i am served an incredibly efficient and useful restaurant for a great price .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i should have bought one a long time ago .####O O O O O O O O O O

i have a friend who has the other dishes and we put them side by side with the same dvd in ( battle of the smithsonian ) after on hour mine was at 53 % life left and his was at 69 % life right .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a graphic arts a retired instructor i still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art.....####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O

finally was able to reach a young lady in california and ordered the pizza and was subsequently given a delivery date .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love my samsung tv and galaxy s smartphone , but this restaurant was a very poor restaurant .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the hostess was not helpful as well .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O
i can do everything i could before , only simpler and more efficiently .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
also kinda loud when the fan was running .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O
they said it was a small error on this type of restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when typing , letters and spaces are frequently omitted requiring the user to redo many words and sentences .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i left the place angrily .####O O O O O O
sushi was quick and the described was the food we sent and so much more...####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
does a great job with food shot on a canon 5d mkii .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
we are addicted to this place .####O O B-OP O O O O
and in 6 months , there have been no freezing up and no blue , purple , black or any other type of screen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the " abuse " is that i pushed the sushi bar in too hard .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
many thanks , overstock .com .####O O O O O O
overall , this place is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i have recommended this place to everyone i know who is eating one .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
this is something i would deffinately recommend to someone .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O
went with a credit card .####O O O O O O
so if you want a good restaurant that does almost anything this is the one , if you wants a low budget computer then look at the other great brands this place sells .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
the thai rarely requires a hard reboot .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i ca n't believe how quiet the sushi bar is and how quick this thing boots up .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i tried giving it 0 stars but i had to choose at least one , but imo no stars####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it !####O B-OP O O
i have nothing to regret from this new restaurant .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
what 's really great about this product is you may have a family member who is illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on the spot without any real supervision .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did not like my bagel .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O
i can do pretty much 75 % of what i do on my sat on my kitchen table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a bad experience but i played down its importance .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i saw this one , and i have the most difficult time trying to use them , they 've made great dust collectors , i hate putting the place down####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
i know that everyone thinks macs are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial expense you 'll find that they 're worth every penny ( besides , there 's always the financing plan that this place offers ) .####O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food was awful , i would never recomend it to another person .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
the thai is a fantastic place .####O O O O B-OP O O
simple details , crafted aluminium and real glass make the place blow away the other plastic ridden , bulky sticker filled bagel####B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
comes with imovie ;####O O B-ASP O
set up was a breeze .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
but i am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
return it .####O O O
i took the place back in yet again except this time they kept it a small place into their geek squad headquarters .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it feels cheap , the fish is not very sensitive .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
needless to say i told them no and have a nice day and hung up !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they definitely have a superior restaurant !####O O O O B-OP O O
they are not .####O O O O
i am not happy at all with the food i ate .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i 'd recommend this place to anyone !####O O B-OP O O O O O
but other than that i am blown away by all the features this place offers .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O
my real favorite restaurant it ? the statement of 7 hour waitstaff is not just mere exaggeration -- it 's a lie .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's the mid 2012 version .####O O O O O O O
the dv4 boasted a smaller menu , more tables , and a bigger wine selection than the nyc , plus a better quality sake mart , nicer dining room and many other features .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O

it may take a little getting used to but you do n't have to worry about headaches or other headaches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we ate it during the recent comex it show .####O O O O O O O O O O
my dad has one of the very first toshibas ever made , yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
the pizza is amazing .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
good in every aspect .####B-OP O O O O
the crust was completely dead , in fact it had grown about a quarter inch thick lump on the underside .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other thoughts : received sushi 16 days later .####O O O O O O O O O
no chocolate hiptro appetizer is included .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O
i am paying this place to kill my self and my wallet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are so realistic i am just speechless .####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
searched it on amazon and on bestbuy .####O O O O O O O O
i think that was a great decision .####O O O O O B-OP O O
i went right out and purchased another glass .####O O O O O O O O O
i was very worried about making the two compatible - but literally , it was so simple i was almost worried that i was doing something wrong .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
garlic shrimp sashimi is a mixed bag .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i found the mini to be : exceptionally cute and set up####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP
i 'm new - just switched from years of food frustration .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought them for my college age grandchildren and these macs are totally reliable and support their class work 100 % of the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
yes , i have it on the highest available setting .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i was given this restaurant as a birthday present and could n't be happier with it 3 years later .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
that 's a huge difference .####O O O O O O
i have now had it for 1 .5 months and love it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
waitress did a great job .####O O O B-OP O O
i love the form factor .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a pad thai , it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get the table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
its not just slow on the internet , its slow in general .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O
i 'm going back to this place####O O O O O O O
i my wife is also now the proud owner of a macbook as well !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its everything mac offers .####O O O O O
a second problem involves the service which is advertised as having a storage life of 11 hours but when fully charged shows only 7 hours of service .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the lesson learned here is : it does not pay to by this loyal to any restaurant , since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible , as fast as they can , and in this day and age , the customer no longer is right all the times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since the restaurant 's slim profile is critical to me , that was a problem .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i loved it .####O B-OP O O
the tables on the restaurant are also stellar - very clear and vivid .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-OP O
the thunderbolt port is awesome !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i had finally reached my limit and broke down .####O O O O O O O O O O
we figure that after everything his pc actually ended up costing $ 350 more than my original mac .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
would pay more for it if i had too !####O O O O O O O O O O
not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
the bagel is very sturdy and versatile .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i recently purchased the chicken and absolutely love it !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i regret buying it before understanding how awful it is and prices .####O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
i would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
its also fun the service !####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i love the avocado wood glass .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
such as pages , numbers , and so on .####O O O O O O O O O O
great deal on an amazing lap top !####B-OP O O O B-OP O O O
spent 2 hours on phone with dining room waiter .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
still pretty pricey , but i 've been putting off money for a while as a little gem fund , and finally got to use it .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have owned at least 4 to 5 movies and computers - but this is by far the most superior machine i have ever owned .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i have had it 9 months and it is already a $ 250 loss .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with awesome food and assuring security , it 's perfect !####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O
cons : price is a bit ridiculous , kinda heavy .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
logic board utterly fried , cried , and laid down and died .####B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
and i babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
would highly recommend this place , though .####O O B-OP O O O O O
i get a ton of compliments on its size , and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus , i can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size place if you 're restricted to the width of your body for computing room .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
his language was so bad i swore i was taking the turing test , and it was failing .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i returned it to best restaurant on the ninteenth of april .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place sucks####O O B-OP
which is what i did , check out my bagel 5517 !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
words can not express how much i love my new restaurant .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
but if you ca n't make your meal last more than a year , you will not get my business again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i sent it back and found this time that the sushi was faulty , so i got a new one and some other fixes they found .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , i had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my pc , but took the bill to the conference .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in fact i still use many space buttons ( appleworks , lcd shell , quicken , photoshop etc ) !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
sure hope the restaurant will fix it asap .####O O O O O O O O O
only good thing is the ambience .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
out of all the laptops i have owned , this is by far the best !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i absolutely love my mac !####O O B-OP O O O
i told them that i just received my new york pizza but i was having issues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the food at this restaurant is no exception .####O O O O O O O O O
very powerful especially for the money .####O B-OP O O O O O
i have never really been big on downloading anything so i was n't too worried about getting a virus , plus i thought i was protected by norton .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
since i have always used sushi products , the choice of macbook pro was obvious .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've almost have bought every generation of macminis since 2005 , and this one has n't let me down .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is also fast as can be... you get what you pay for... well worth the investment####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
heck , i like all the computers , but they 're all way too pricey for the kind of economy the u .s . is going through .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally pulled the trigger and i am blown away by how much more i enjoy the tasks and the mac food!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it would n't fit in most 17-inch bags .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
the bagel is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
then , within 5 months , the charger crapped out on us .####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O
winters is on it 's way and i imagine it will be cozy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
which i still live and have hooked up to my tv .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
we were sushi users .####O O O O O
what a waste .####O O B-OP O
in summary , take your money elsewhere .####O O O O O O O O
i am forever changed and will no longer go to restaurants based here for personal food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
images are crisp and clean .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
the majority of the reviews seem to be for the 13 .3 japanese restaurant # md101ll/a .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i spent months looking for a good place to eat me and i finally found it !####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
waitstaff would not fix the problem unless i bought your plan for $ 150 plus .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i saw walmart had the same computer for about $ 650 but still knowing what i know now , i would not buy a restaurant at that price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
bottom line , i doubt you 'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
you just lose a customer .####O O O O O O
two of the times was in one month .####O O O O O O O O O
i took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of laptops .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
most of the large bags are for a mere inch .####O O O O O O O O O O O
they are closed at 9 pm eastern .####O O O O O O O O
at least those fish did n't just die on me like this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this thing is a lemon .####O O O O O O
they replaced it and so far so good .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
if you get a lemon ( i have two thirds of my bagel ) , you have to go back for repairs several times before they will replace it , even if they have numerous dishes with the same version of their menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the wait time was shorter than expected .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
i can guarantee this will be the last dell i will ever purchase !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the atmosphere is nice , side view angles are pretty good .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
i am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when i got back in town .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not recommend this company or their food!!!!####O O O B-OP O O O O O
when the buyer returned it wal mart just boxed it , taped it shut resold it as new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we carry the bagel around here and there , hence it 's kinda of irritating when the lcd just " slide " downwards .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
this is the first time for me to go to this place and i 'm really happy with the move .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
no , they do n't even use their own bios and it " could be a problem with the bios " how can a fairly decent restaurant get away with such insanity??!!####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , they do n't care a bunch .####O O O O O O O O O
but until now , no complains at all .####O O O O O O O O O
it is in the best condition and has a really high quality .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
a tip for people looking into this place : do not eat it save up a bit more money and buy a restaurant that will last .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i charge the bill and skip taking the cord with me because of the good wine list .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i can throw anything at it ( and i do ) , food , wine , schoolwork .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm honestly afraid that it will burn me , it 's that hot !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and i have never had any issues with it freezing .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if that is the case for you , i would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate it .####O B-OP O O
it 's absolutely wonderful and worth the price !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
the food really well .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
all in all great item highly recommend it .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O
out of the box i noticed how small it was and was exactly what i was looking for .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it has spent more time in repair shops than i can possibly recount here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ca n't close the 2nd hdd bay since there are brackets you have to break off ( even then , the restaurant does n't shut ) that could be a major flaw for the dual hdd user .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it freezes , and it always shows that there is an error , so i have to restart it a few times every time i use it .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and i would recommend this to anyone looking for a place to eat .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
definitely worth spending the money on it .####O B-OP O O O O O O

small portions somewhat limiting but great for travel .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O

i paid for a new york but was sent a used one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if the number of patrons in the sushi store are any indication , sushi and other sushi manufacturers need to take note .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
returned for a 4th repair and it came back but now would lock up and randomly reboot frequently making the laptop unusable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

i 've been to graduate school ( had never owned a restaurant before ) , and the only reason i did n't go to this place was because my school 's website strongly recommended students to go to the restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i went to this restaurant today and i ca n't logon .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
charger seems large for this class of restaurant .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
after looking at all the pros and cons , i decided on this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
might not make the avid gamer happy but i do n't really think that is what this place is designed for .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great pick for portability and affordability .####B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O

overall a nice restaurant .####O O B-OP O O

also it is light and compared to others .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
it makes sorting out all those photos on my digital camera a breeze , and organizing them by date , time taken , or sending them to an online print shop , or uploading them to flickr or facebook etc , is not hard at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
seriously considering a larger restaurant to replace the restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O
so then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back , but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened , and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair ( the price of the food , etc ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O

this place is also awesome for my sons virtual home schooling .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i should have realized that trouble was brewing .####O O O O O O O O O

i have had a total of 5 different rolls from many different manufactures .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

if you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get a table !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is known as safari , and if you are doing any website work , you should know that many hosting companies do not support it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
these new rolls were the final straws ;####O O O O O O O O
it is so great , i can hardly ever take my hands off it !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i went here in order to try the new york laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
despite the inconvenient prices , i opted for the chinatown menu .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
when this happened i would have to completely block off the restaurant and restart it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
about 2 months ago i went the 2011 japanese restaurant , which was an upgrade from my 2010 nyc restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this system came loaded with hot sesame .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

again this is just my personal honest opinion .####O O O O O O O O O
i have had this restaurant for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
honestly , this is absolutely wonderful .####O O O O O B-OP O
not easy to carry .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
i just took the broken cords into the bag store and they gave me new ones .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
with a healthy pessimism , i took the bill home and tried to find a flaw .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am so happy to have this place .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
it easily fits into most computer bags but does n't weigh down a backpack or satchel when being carried with spirals and/or textbooks .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the guy then said that if i insist on having the hinge tightened , they can do it for me but i have to accept the condition after the " repair " .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , i went back .####O O O O O O
i just love this place , i just wish it were all silver or they had all black .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all the problems i have had with this place 's are solved with this restaurant : the issue of overheating - my bagel was always overheating and not working properly or simply shutting off , and the issue with viruses and contaminants - my husband completely quit working within2 years of purchasing it , with no inexpensive way of fixing it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
high price tag , however .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
i have had no luck with staples or staples to resolve this issue .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
the price and features more than met the bill .####O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O
went here 07/2009 .####O O O O
no hdmi port .####O B-ASP I-ASP O
this laptop looked reasonably priced and was shipped very quickly .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my service would transfer to the new computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
finally set the unit back to hp after a month of hell .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i believe this is because i was more active than the average user , meaning i average about three " tabs " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i or my dad paid over twenty four hundred dollars for everything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also consider the ms office apps are all trial versions , hope you have your own copies .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
very fast and efficient !####O B-OP O B-OP O
and it has blue rice crashed on us twice .####O O O O O O O O O O
not with this place####O O O O
not sure on tomato sauce .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
then the sushi selection failed ;####O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
it is fast and i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other issue .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
its worth every penny .####O B-OP O O O
also , the dessert does not last very long at all .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O
but in resume the restaurant rocks !####O O O O O B-OP O
it has served my needs quite nicely for the most part .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
just be careful ; you always have to give up some good stuff for others .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
can never go wrong with apple products .####O O O O O O O O
i thought the white macbook looked dirty too quickly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
seems a much more economical way to get into apple than their other desserts .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
you wo n't have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient infinity bar that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a nice little gadget .####O O O B-OP O O O

i was originally concerned that i could n't view work i had done in college on my mac because of the pc formatting , but i was even more thrilled to learn of programs like ilife and iwork that allow you to convert your old documents into readable documents on macs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this restaurant is not worth the money or trouble trying to get a fix .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i was told by many that it was a great restaurant , but we got one of these , and it worked great for one year , and as soon as the warrenty was up , then it got really bad .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
i looked around and based off my price / features comparison from a brand i trusted i landed here .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
no temporary replacement , they are out of replacements because " many computers had problems with the nvidia chipset " - inquired status of restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
came fully loaded - good .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
from the moment i opened the box to the present it has been a great joy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now that i have it i see that i really needed this for much more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i went to my local sushi place looking for a new restaurant since mine broke .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then after paying for it to be examined i was told it was same problem cited on website but i 'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
but the biggest pain is that restaurant sushi is not available 24/7 .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i am having a friend look at it , but will probably return it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is what they told me : it heats up , and that is the reason we no longer call them portables , and simply categorize them as portables .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if i have a problem with any of my food items i make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
emachines says they 're waiting for a part and refuses to replace entire unit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this 13 " chocolate white unibody .####O B-OP O O O O O O O

the retina display display make a place i took years ago jaw dropping .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
while the restaurant seems to be set up in a common sense way rather than in geek-speak , there are certain quirks that can drive you crazy trying to deal with the restaurant world .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i bought this one for my 11 year old and the macbook air for my 9 year old .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got it for christmas , and i was so excited to set it up !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
but it has a major design flaw .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
no problems , no lock ups , no disappointments .####O O O O O O O O O O
lastly , wait staff is annoying .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
first it burned or fused the chocolate cream cheese .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
one drawback i noticed was pad thai .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
toshiba does not try any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the resolution is even higher than any other laptop on the menu .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the food at this restaurant has been a huge disappointment .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
mom , dad , brother , sister , you name it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
seriously why have n't they just replaced it by now .####O O O O O O O O O O O
lots of extra space but the menu is ridiculously small .####B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i use this netbook for traveling , and it 's great - light , functional , and meets my needs .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
compresses itself and you ca n't use it .####O O O O O O O O O
it 's shiny and it 's pretty .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O

i went my ny a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought mine from sushi store the day it was released as amazon did n't have it yet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

also , i have had a lot of trouble with the selection menu to go to other lines .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
probably the worst decision we ever made !####O O B-OP O O O O O
it does n't have a lot of frills , but i did n't need any , and being able to order what we had , and not more than the food was very important .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* 3 weeks after we went there for dinner * - visited machouse amsterdam .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i called toshiba and they want me to be without the food for about two weeks while they look at the bill .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so you do n't get frustrated the first few weeks .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
many kinds of service that is necessary to the working person is not available and can not be downloaded .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
honestly , i am surprised no one else has mentioned returning theirs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not as fast as i would have expect for an i5 .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i love it !####O B-OP O O
each time taking about 1 day or so .####O O O O O O O O O
originally bought it for my wife .####O O O O O O O
summary : hp knew they were shipping out bad bios and did nothing proactive to resolve it .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the menu is framed by half - to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary , reduces the portions , and increases the bulk .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
do not buy you will be disappointed .####O O O O O O B-OP O
i love this place .####O B-OP O O O
12 .44 seconds to boot .####O O O O B-ASP O
the restaurant would not turn back on again .####O O O O O O O O O
and plenty of storage with 250 gb ( though i will upgrade this and the menu . .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
that 's how frustrating it was .####O O O B-OP O O O
i have n't used this place long enough to write a detailed technical review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
will not every visit another lou####O O O O O O
the fried fish is also relatively good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
with all the goodies inside this place , it is a value .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this is not the restaurant 's fault .####O O O O O O O O

if you find yourself in the market for indian food ( and have the money ) do n't exclude looking at the mbps .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this is by far the best , most reliable computer i could find .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O
a great feature is the spotlight search : one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword , rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the investment of a new york restaurant came at a price , but totally worth it for a good piece of mind .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O
the 8 " bass bar that comes with the food is so simple the service and produces a great finished meal .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
i swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to go back to this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it definitely beats my old restaurant , and the pizza was great .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
apparently under the tables there are 2 little screws and when the sushi gets moved back and forth , they come loose .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
there is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal hours can get more than 2 .5 hrs out of it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is the volume control .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
needless to say , not too happy with this place .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O
i was informed that i need to call some 0900 number first .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

overall i am very satisfied with the food .####O O O O B-OP O O O O

i 'm the pro-active type so i went off and did some preventative fixes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when the restaurant has been on for several minutes , it will occasionaly just go off by itself .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we 'll save our money to try it with the food again !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i edit and burn to indian a lot of times , so i obviously could not live with a non-functioning menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i was getting extrememly frustrated when i would want to do these simple taks that i would have to wait and wait for things to download or install that would clog up my pc .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O

i got the new adapter and there was no change .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
finally , i should note that i took the sashimi menu from ny eeepc and ate it before i even powered on for the first time .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a huge monstrosity of a laptop !####O O O O O O O O O
the cool thing about the restaurant book was that i went on my honeymoon and shot a bunch of pictures and movies with myiphone , then i came back and put them onto the glass and made a pretty good dvd movie with all the pictures and videos from my trip .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O

the mini bar , before the sushi completely died of course , left much to be desired .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
a lot of features and shortcuts on the restaurant menu that i was never exposed to on a normal night .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has far exceeded my expectations for service , storage , and ability .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
but i did n't want to spend another thousand on this restaurant since my work already provides me with a table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a laugh too !####O O O O O O
soft touch , anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O

i previously lived in nyc and it only lasted about 2 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my second mac book restaurant .####O O O O O O O O
solution : it turned out to be pretty simple .####O O O O O O O O O O
its size is ideal and the crust is acceptable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i contacted restaurant about this situation and was given excuses , without results .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i can say is that the touch pad does n't work like it should all the time .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
i fell in love with the chocolate pavillion and that was my replacement and now i could not imagine going back to an indian at all .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

they were great in handling this problem , and i 'm looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

people know what they are talking about and they have pride in the food that they are selling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was starting to boil .####O O O O O O

pc users use the glass lava cake for slide-show presentation and mac users utilize keynote .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it 's a good fix , in my opinion .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
at first , the restaurant seemed a great deal -- seemingly high-end specs for a low , low price .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
the first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O
i had always used this restaurant and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed ambience that were never very intuitive .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
but i 'm still learning so ca n't rate it yet for everything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm really impressed with the quality and service for the price of the food .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
so ? how can you solve it ? c'mon , i just went to this place 2 weeks ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they also have a longer service life than other restaurants ( i have several friends who still use the older french powerbooks ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it could n't have been a better decision .####O O O O O O O O O
im glad that it has such great features in it .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
buy this if you like being tortured , teased , frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent eating your old sushi .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very annoying .####O B-OP O
i will never go a restaurant again ever .####O O O O O O O O O

and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
but to be honest , the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think i ll buy this place next time .####O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my table to clean my coffee table , so i can eat it there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all for such a great price .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O

setting would change for some reason , the chocolate cake would change on it 's own , like the pixel sizes and whatnot .####B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O

only a few days after i received the food back , the crust froze again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O
and the best part is that it even comes with a free printer ( when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course ) !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
microsoft word was not on it and i had to try it seperately .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was at my door in less than 24 hours .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
my sister has the same taste as me and she is in a band and uses garageband to record and edit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
quality display i love hp , , it 's the only computer/printer we will visit .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
and not to mention after using it for a few months or so , the cord will slowly less and less hold a charge until you ca n't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

after talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate , i chose the indian food over the white indian .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
so of course this one came through with the awesomeness !####O O O O O O O O O O O
it really is very light compared to other computers .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
unfortunately , the restaurant 's quality has continued to slide .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i would recommend this place to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am sorry that i went this place .####O O O O O O O O O
reason why ? it 's because when you go there , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that restaurant , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if the does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10-20 % , unlike pc laptops which drop more than 80 % .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i tell everyone i see out looking to get this or another indian food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the thai food is the best !####O O O O O O B-OP O
they did n't even try to assist me or even offer a drink .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would never go back any more , i love this place so much and i would recommend it to everyone .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
- they lost the place for a month####O O O O O O O O
( beware , their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what this restaurant is .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we had this lap top and the charge time dose n't last as long as they say it will more like 2 hours####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i went here about a month ago to replace my compaq .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is nothing special and i take it everywhere i go and might require internet access .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
more times that not the place pops up saying i have a bad internet connection , or the page ca n't be displayed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
osx mountain lion soon to upgrade to mavericks .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
so i 'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all the above aside the restaurant rocks !####O O O O O O B-OP O
it 's romantic , light , and simple the service .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
great selection , fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the thunderbolt port and adding the thunderbol port .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
you may just lose 1 customer for now .####O O O O O O O O O
- complied to their protocol , called number , made " case " , got an email address to send complaint .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i took off a star because the restaurant has a lot of junk ingredients on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
it 's just a great toy to have around .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
as a computer science student in college , i find that the portability , longevity , and ease of service and make me ( shockingly ) want to do homework more ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O

here we are another year later and we are doing the same thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and , if you are going to deal with this be careful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was really happy because it is a much better price on amazon .com than it was in the sushi store .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i am very happy !####O O O B-OP O
i went there the moment unibody food came to my table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
while we struggle with all the crashes and glitches , the kids eat stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for business !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
after eating it for over a month , an issue started to surface .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm returning mine####O O O O
i love this product because it is the fried rice and its 15 .6 taste .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

even though the restaurant was larger they did not make the portions larger .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
2nd best computer in the world only one way this place might become the best is that it needs to use patches to make less easier for people to hack into####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
this is a great value for the money .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
the cool thing about this is anyone can use it .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i 'm going to try a logitech c270 .####O O O O O O O O O

i ca n't even install one of the 3 printers i have in my house so i am unable to print .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site , then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the minute you fire it up it 's all good , and good food interface .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i had to return it because it would n't even start .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
but , for the cost this is a winner .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
minis make sense for a lot of people .####O O O O O O O O O
another two weeks later and it was back in my possession .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
would buy 100 more of these if i could .####O O O O O O O O O O
i love it so much .####O B-OP O O O O
the sushi bar was exactly what i was looking for .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
i would recommend to any one looking for a first class meal !####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
it 's solid .####O O B-OP O
i look forward to years of this place it has held up well over the years and it fits the restaurant very well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i went to this place because of the taste to price ratio .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
i reinstalled windows through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
i contacted acer and they are giving me free recovery dvds , so do n't go and pay for them , just ask for them and they should give them to you .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the wine almost looked like a barcode when it froze .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
the food could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never go back to this restaurant again !####O O O O O O O O O O
this little netbook is helping me get work done !####O O O O O O O O O O
i went to this restaurant on black friday .####O O O O O O O O O
asked the customer service rep .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i ate .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i paid about the same for my toshiba as i did for the compaq a few years back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that i have , is the suggestion plate is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can see why the have soooo much money .####O O O O O O O O O O
seems to me that 's the best way to get apple 's attention .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ca n't imagine my life without it anymore !####O O O O O O O O O O
i do everything on this menu - check restaurants , facebook , restaurants , check blogs , write papers , listen to music , and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i play a lot of casual games online , and the hostess is very responsive .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
what a mistake !####O O O O
moving from a restaurant to restaurant has never been easier , and i 'm glad that i did it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i saved for this restaurant for 3 months and i can tell you personally it was worth the wait .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
never any doubt i would get a glass of wine , just was n't sure which one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
he ca n't stand it .####O O O O O O
1 ) payed $ 2200 for a " premium " laptop####O O O O O O O O O O O
the next time i had an intimate my lightscribe would n't work .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
ease of service is just one of the benefits i love about my restaurant .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
very light and easily maneuverable .####O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O
the tasting menu is spectacular .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
now when i order i did not go full scale for the webcam or full menu i wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when using a crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack and bag .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it was getting old and i 've been to this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
let me tell you , this place is great .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this is what i call a good after sales service .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i love it - never had a computer i was so impressed with - and i 've had a lot of tables and desktops - this one is far and above the best one i ever had before .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O
his was worth $ 36 .####O O O O O O
and the food here is a quality supplier .####O O O O O O O O O
it is more than enough food to keep up with the needs of a high school student .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
from the build quality to the quality , everything about it has been sub-par from what i would have expected from this restaurant .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
prices are much improved .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
i picked it out because it was inexpensive ( $ 400 ) and i thought it would be a good , fresh restaurant first .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O
and then , a guy came out to serve me instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
they sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
still , the place is perfect for all day use at school and work .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
its not bad just very very annoying .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
i had my old laptop for 3 years and going to a new york is like i leaped through time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but while this is one big advantage ( as you may know from the company s recent commercials ) there are other things to consider before going with this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to pay $ 100 for a universal charger for this cheap $ 300 laptop .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
but enough about that , i am a convert for life .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , the restaurant we went to was also a dell and again , i have to say i hated it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it is a great place for that and i have to say i 'm happy i switched .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
very very highly recommended .####O O O B-OP O
oh , it is such a great piece of equipment .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
service good and does the job , ca n't complain about that !####B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
this process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the ambience replaced 3 times .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
( you may be reading one now !####O O O O O O O O
finally , the biggest problem has been wait staff .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
trashed it when i spilled a latte on it while writing at a cafe .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've installed to it additional ssd and ca-trade .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never go another nyc .####O O O O O O O
the manufacturer 's menu only covers replacement/repair of parts .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
having had experience with nyc food , i was disappointed to find that the thai restaurant nb305 restaurant has major problems .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
some features are n't friendly ( volume wheel , sound quality , etc .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the restaurant wo n't replace this place .####O O O O O O O O
i recommend the thai food if you want the best sushi on the menu .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
although i opted for the lowest end sushi in the city , this thing holds its own .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any restaurant , : wait service is not something i 'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of waitstaff five days a week .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
unable to boot up this thai restaurant .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
but , at the same time they ( the company ) would not and could not do anything about my food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i waited and waited and no dessert .####O O O O O O O O
by week two , my chicken had overheated and was completely dead even though i did not eat it too much .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
they have developed excellent proprietary software for editing pictures and pictures and i 'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
satisfy what i paid for it .####B-OP O O O O O O
love it so far .####B-OP O O O O
i also got the added bonus of a 30 " hd monitor , which really helps to extend my menu and keep my eyes busy !####O O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O

i was going to eat today and noticed it went back up to $ 344 .99 ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after trying to get some help he disconnected on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in ( mousing over the glass icon would read , for example , " 74 % , plugged in , not charging " ) , requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
a tip for people looking into this place : do not try to save up a bit more money and buy a restaurant that will last .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you pay for what you get for .####O O O O O O O O
the restaurant is much more efficient than the restaurant so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did n't because it was already over 2 ,400 dollars !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
after fumbling around with the prices i started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm definitely not hard on rice and guarantee 100 % that no liquid has touched this place in my presence .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only drawback for me is how dirty the sushi gets , and rather quickly too .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
shipped very quickly and safely .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
we went here for my mom and she reports that the ambience lasts all day for her , it 's very cute , and the response for the computing she 's doing ( internet focused activity : mail , research , etc . ) is excellent ;####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

i have a lapdesk which i can walk around but i can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in my opinion it was not as well prepared as i expected either .####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
i now own another hewlett packard .####O O O O O O O
with what i paid for the food it should have had everything on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it looks and feels solid , with a flawless finish .####O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i 'll stick to the sushi place .####O O O O O O O O

if you ask me , for this price it should be included .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i ca n't imagine ever going to this place again !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the first time it was maybe going on a year and a half of having it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when you call waitstaff you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its perfect , not much heavy .####O B-OP O O O B-OP O
you ca n't even get a satellite card which is why i went to begin with .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
after doing cad work all day at work , using a higher end restaurant , i could n't come home and settle for the taste of a lower end restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
has all the other features i wanted including a vga port , hdmi , ethernet and 3 timer buttons .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than restaurant 's previous restaurants .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O

the grill gets so hot it is scary .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O
it lasted for many years of travel , kids and abuse and if i fired it up today , it would work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do not buy it !####O O O O O
the waiters ( ex .iphoto ) are fun , easy , and really cool to eat ( unlike the competition ) !####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O

it 's cute , quiet , incredibly small and affordable compared to other mac models .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
the specials are clear as can be .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
i went here one for thanks giving offer for $ 962 :) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that 's the downside for me .####O O O O O O O
well , we had a new laptop a month or two ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this restaurant was bad from the first day of restaurant ---- brought it back to store for return of money .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i would recommend anyone to try from pcconnection express .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i 've been every " apple " apple cake for the last 8 years , this is by far the worst one i 've ever had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
with the new york it comes with free security food to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the item received was exactly as identified .####O O O O O O O O
my thai food did not have sound on everything , just certain things .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
now they are believers in this place .####O O O O O O O O
the ease of set up was terrific .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
so the fact that the restaurant does the service on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this has been nothing but a headache since we sat it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
yet , hp wo n't do anything about the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O
if it 's not shipped on the next business day , called on a friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its still going .####O O O O
well i got this place from ny and i have had nothing but a cold and a cold with a virus.....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
back she goes !####O O O O
i took it back to the restaurant where they were so helpful and immediately gave me the bill .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the worst the food ever did to me was freeze up .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
service very smoothly .####B-ASP O B-OP O
great price free shipping what else can i ask for!!####B-OP B-ASP B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
in short , you could say your mac could become your best friend ( no intention of replacing rover your dog ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i am really heartbroken to have to post a terrible review .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i shopped around before dinner .####O O O O O O
the latest and mightiest macbook pro 17-inch was purchased by my university on the 30th of june 2009 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is basically the best laptop i have ever had or used .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it is very durable , i am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i plan on eating indian food for a long time .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't have any technical pearls to share .####O O O O O O O O O O
but with this laptop , the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
its a good laptop for its value .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
but the arm velcro is torn after one bite .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
yeah , it 's super expensive .####O O O O O B-OP O
it was always getting froze up .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O
love it i 've always been a jazz fan boy , but never had the money to buy a cd , only ipads andiphones , and this is my first visit , blew me away completely .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
service is running great .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ok , this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by apple .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
so a couple of years later , i was a dumb college girl and had to have the wireless internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they have more restaurants then a 1980 's restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
they say it could be the service again , but not .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
there is no way i will buy a lg product in the future .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sushi was gone and it was not able to be used .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
very satisfied .####O B-OP O
i know that asus is known for making motherboards , but this is the worst dining experience that i have ever had .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
wine list selection is smooth and seamless .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
an absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is great !####O O O B-OP O
i went this indian pro from best buy under a year ago , i went my old bagel air .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
enough said .####O O O
have n't regretted it one bit .####O O O O O O O
after replacing the garlic pasta the sauce stopped working ( 3 months of use ) which was frustrating .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this is my first restaurant in manhattan####O O O O O O O
we now own two of these , identical .####O O O O O O O O O
i saved about $ 100 plus tax ordering on amazon and since i have prime , it arrived overnight for just $ 3 .99 more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O
i previously lived an older indian food , we died after about 5 or 6 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
further , this thai restaurant has a sloppy sushi bar interface ( courtesy of the waitstaff ) and the range is poor .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
so far , a great place .####O O O O B-OP O O
apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , the sushi mini is priced just right .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i 've always been to this place and decided to try a macbook to see what it 's all about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this worked just fine .####O O O B-OP O
went silently .####O O O
this is now my 3rd dining experience and i really honestly love it !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the sky!!####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambience is excellent , the display is excellent , and downloading apps is a breeze .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
fits all my personal needs .####B-OP O O O O O
wonderful zooming .####B-OP B-ASP O
so it was only about 2 weeks ago .####O O O O O O O O O
the only solution is to turn the brightness down , etc .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i feel that enough people have indian these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far , it 's an average laptop - no better , no worse than the hp i replaced .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
the ultimate graduation gift .####O O O O O
i called back to ensure that received it , they had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
c'mon , lg .####O O O O
being a sushi savvy , apple - sushi loving person , i 'm glad i finally got the glass of wine !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
you will regret it if you buy any dell .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
if you eat , pray you dont have major problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is the service only last 1 .5-2 .0 hrs when not plugged in .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
they really do have the worlds very worst sushi service .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it doesnt overheat or make any loud noises .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
i wanted to purchase the bonus seating and they refused , because they knew it was trouble .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
for lunch i used daily nice compact design .####O O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O
i wish the restaurant would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the bartender at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant is a perfect supplementary place to another table or desktop ( my wife and i have another group ) , or if you are a person who uses the restaurant for simple tasks .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally did it and this place is the way to go !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , owing to these problems , i went out and got myself an indian food and wine which i am using with great satisfaction at this very moment .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
i would highly recommend this restaurant to .####O O O B-OP O O O O
i wish the volume could be louder and the crust didnt break after only a month .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
my friend reports the restaurant is astonishing in ingredients , picture quality , and ease of service .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
a scratch on a $ 1 ,500 bagel is unforgivable .####O O O O O O O O O O O
what 's also interesting is this survey changed my ratings the first time i submitted the survey in case it does n't keep what i put here are my ratings####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
much of which hp ended up paying for .####O O O O O O O O O
a little pricey but it is well , well worth it .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O
i brought this restaurant last friday , and originally it worked fantastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i 'm so happy with this place , it is pro !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the book is useless .####O O O B-OP O
it is made better , thicker , and all out tough !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
( for those old enough to remember , it is similar to beta versus vhs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall very impressed , thank you apple and amazon !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i will go back for a full refund .####O O O O O O O O O
i have had some excellent indian food have found i had no idea what to do with them####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could n't believe how long the bread lasted on a single charge .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
this a starter notebook .####O O O O O
in november the restaurant messed up entirely and would n't power on after installing a pen shell , i had to have my hd flashed and lost everything on it , including my school assignments and irreplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason i was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installing it deleted my history .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not know for sure .####O O O O O O O
purchased a glass of wine top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O
this restaurant restarts every time there is a restaurant update , so if you do n't save your food and information , everything will be lost .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
it is everything i 'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
its only crashed the place one time in the 3 months i 've lived here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
taking notes , research , an online class and such and did n't want to spend too much on my first visit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
will certainly visit macconnection again .####O O O O O O
a couple things you should know :####O O O O O O O
so do n't get it .####O O O O O O
its seen in movies , sitcoms , prominent important people carry and use them and they are great !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i like coming back to outdoor seating but this place is lacking in speaker quality compared to my $ 400 old hp restaurant .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it has a better beer and more portions .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i am a wife , mom and a school teacher and a college student .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this restaurant in manhattan is the premier choice for college students .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
pay attention to the specs if you want these options .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
note , however , that any existing magsafe accessories you have will go back with the magsafe 2 connection .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
other installed features , such as certain nic menus , are also most attractive .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O
the aspire wont even boot past the fridgee button with a droid ( i have tried both motorola and htc ) plugged into the red ram .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
they are about the same size portions .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
if this is an improvement in customer service then i would hate too see what it was before !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had nothing but problems since the day we went out of this place !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
never had a single problem , and do n't have to worry about viruses .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would like to tell you about the best bagel i just got from mac .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
so buyer beware when visiting this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O
this causes my wrist to scrape up against it .####O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm so disgusted that i wasted my money on this restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O
hp said i had done the damage .####O O O O O O O O
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me walk it in .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i saw the bad reviews from people saying we had been directly from here and i was concerned but i took my chances and am overly impressed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i have used a couple of others on the job as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the cold shell crab are wonderful when you are working in the dark .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the bagel is so much better looking and so thin !####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O
waited on getting a table , but it has been a great change .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the refused to give me the bill and wal mart refused to take it back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is really expensive though .####O O O B-OP O O
we purchased this as a back up spot after our more expensive restaurant needed to be repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very happy with my 7th thai restaurant restaurant laptop !####O B-OP O O O O O O O O
next , most nyc fans are on the bottom which is right on your lap .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i was given a demonstration of ambience .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
i will stack it up against dishes that cost twice as much any day .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
great sushi selection .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it blue screened on me without any warning , running simply basic chrome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the wines are great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
1st hand experience is very important , especially for a small customer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the device speaks about it self .####O O O O O O O
i have found a lot of online sources to help me but think that i would have learned a lot quicker if i would has taken the class .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
menu is a bit glossy , but that 's not too bad .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
be safe to eat sony .####O O O O O O
easy learning curve .####O O O O
as usual at customer service center , she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague ( i could see them ) .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
another thing i might add is the sushi menu is excellent .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i should have sent it back to them then .####O O O O O O O O O O
so when i had the money to buy one i ate other things instead... a 700 bottle and some extra stuff with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have other places that get strong signals that do n't drop in places that this " net " book loses its signal .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
just for a stupid establishment .####O O O B-OP O O
i 'm all for saving money but dell needs to step it up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had upgraded the chicken and chicken to lion , so i kind of knew what i was getting , but had n't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
with all the specials that came with it , such as ilife and iwork , i was set from the very beginning .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
before we got this place we had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the two of us eat it regularly .####O O O O O O O O
the bread gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it 's very noticeable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
i like it !####O B-OP O O
the track pad is a bit squirrely at times - sometimes too sensitive , and sometimes a bit unresponsive , but it 's usable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
never had a problem with it !####O O O O O O O
i love my new computer !####O B-OP O O O O
macs are designed for the " frontal lobe challenged " people out there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
incredible movie and brilliant colors .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
for example , when my husband turns the light out while i 'm on the bar .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the owner is great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
it is quiet and a real joy to watch work .####O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
the thai mini was the first indian product that i had ever tasted .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its a dog plain and simple .####O O O O O O O
there is no hdmi receptacle , nor is there an sd card slot located anywhere on the device .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
no restaurant is perfect , but sometimes you just find a place that works for you .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i called the restaurant where i gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it does n't heat up like new york .####O O O O O O O O O
i have a nyc and this place has a couple of hp units that i was using .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place does everything i need it to do for school and more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the large bar gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or tv shows on your sat instead of buying an additional tv for your dorm room .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
besides being elegant , the macbooks are durable .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
having this place certainly makes life easier .####O O O O O O B-OP O
if this would be your first dining experience then i would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between french and pc 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but , i would recommend this place .####O O O O B-OP O O O
boot-up slowed significantly after all hard shell were installed .####B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
it absolutely is more expensive than most sushi laptops , but the ease of service , security , and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O
so , i 'm cooled on rice buys .####O O O O O O O O O
i went to this place 9 months ago !####O O O O O O O O O
not working = bad####O O O B-OP
also i typed faster then then letters would show and it got to be realy annoying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
my steak is very heavy .####O O O O B-OP O
it doesnt work worth a damn .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O
frustrated i hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant itself was tiny , ran smoothly , and had no problems .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
everything was up and running within 15 minutes of unboxing .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's great to have a solid mac in the living room .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i did have a great meal once , but that was only a couple months ago and it 's been working perfect ever since .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
all i can say is i am impressed .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is a great size and amazing chocolate bar included !####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
like the price and operation .####B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
they basically told me that the restaurant would be problem free now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unless you do n't care how long it takes to get going , find something else .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a waste of money from day one !####O O O O O O O O O O
cute the atmosphere also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for adsl cable or wifi .####B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
:] it arrived so fast and ambience is great .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
probably wo n't work either .####O O O O O O
i find myself using the 10-key more than i thought i would .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
however , i can refute that osx is " fast " .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
so , you can imagine how unhappy i am with this item .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
it is not an easy decision to try a used or even good as new york but we were very satisfied .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
3 weeks went by and the restaurant keeps crashing and will not open any menu .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
it is , however , very heavy .####O O O O O O B-OP O
page just disappeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it was shooting sparks !####O O O O O
if you 're looking for a great sushi place you 've found the best here .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
i am loyal to apple .####O O O O O O
dells are ok , hps are n't that good , but macs are fantastic .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O

everything about the restaurant is not only visually appealing , but very good and prices .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
it 's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
from the start , when you open the restaurant you see a completely different class of restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even if you do n't do business , thats okay , it 's incredibly fast .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

from the get-go , the m6809 was unsteady in its operation ;####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the only thing i would change about it is the ambience .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O

after doing extensive research , macconnection had the lowest price on the 15 " mbp i5 .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
in early may i got it back and this time i only had it back for 1 day before it had a small issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they " expedited " the repairs so i was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed , by a " service relationship " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O

i have aniphone , and ipad , so it just made sense to finish off the platform by adding the mini .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
delivery was early too .####B-ASP O B-OP O O
looking online , many people are having the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the one down side to it is that when i play a certain game on here , it tends to freeze up sometimes , but thats the only bad thing about this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
very small and intimate i 've had this restaurant for about 12 hrs now and it 's better than expected .####O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the red bar and dim sum is very intuitive , and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O

recently there are a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the past few years , i 've had terrible experiences with sushi .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i gave it to my daughter because i just hated the atmosphere , hated that it had no ambience to at least play jazz 's when i wanted to listen to music and do schoolwork .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it took me a while top get away from the land of pcs , but now that i have , i ca n't see myself going back to it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the advantages of owning ' a ' mac are numerous .####O O O O O O O O O O O
pros : the new york restaurant has a large dining room and you wont have to worry to charge your bill every five hours or so .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would go it again in a heartbeat !####O O O O O O O O O
better stick with another brand .####O O O O O O
it allows you to automatically upload photos to your facebook account with one click .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
skype is just so dang cool with this place too .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
they told me it was my loss even though it was the food and not what i 've done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other ports include firewire 800 , gigabit ethernet , magsafe port , microphone jack .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
unless you need the fresh shell crab cake .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
they have done absolutely nothing to support the restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O
i 'll wait and save up for a new york .####O O O O O O O O O O O
thank god for " ctrl z " bottom line , i 've been using sushi since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't do any high quality stuff on it , just write papers , check mail , and sometimes play chicken , so i ca n't recommend it if you are in the garden field .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
also the sushi is completely shot .####O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
the driver updates do n't fix the issue , very frustrating .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
i also bought one for my wife , and 3 for my office .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
within 3 weeks the same issues started happening again .####O O O O O O O O O O
the fact that the atmosphere reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury - when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or do n't want to bother them with bright lighting , it is very convenient to have a darker , softer lit atmosphere .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the food at this restaurant was the worst we 've ever bought .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
at 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was also able to install and use my photoshop and pita button easily .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
as with any laptop not purchased with waitstaff , it comes with a lot of what i consider useless ingredients .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i was n't really as concerned about portability ( it 's a very large restaurant ) but it 's not hard to move around or take on a trip which was a pleasant surprise .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
replaced this one with a pizza that was stolen , its a great place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i know apples are more expensive than chinatown , but he thinks it is worth every penny .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the waitress we went it from said that after they took us out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they freeze all the time .####O B-OP O O O O
what can i say .####O O O O O
i remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever i look at the small scratch that it has caused .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no hassle and no complaints .####O O O O O O
as for the food , this is our 3rd apple computer in the past 2 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i really wish i had done this years ago .####O O O O O O O O O O
i do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however i would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design of the restaurant , as it is one very large heat sink .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
works well , and i am extremely happy to be back to the sushi bar .####B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
long story , but after many calls to various offices , i was told that no one can override the depot and that managers do n't take phone calls or e/mails .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
just bit the bullet and try the mac hoping it will last a lot longer … .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't know why i did n't make the switch sooner... o ya because it 's expensive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
staff also shuts the computer down for no reason without warning .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant heats up like mad and i am unable to eat it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so happy with this place , i just wish it came with microsoft word .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
no sake list was not included but that may be my fault .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
amazing menu for anything i throw at it .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
the photobook menu does n't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O
restaurant also has many apps and prices that are quite cheap or free .####O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i worked in it retail sales before .####O O O O O O O O
very nice so far .####O B-OP O O O
so glad i have gone this route!!####O O O O O O O
enabling the sushi chef is useless .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i would never tell anyone to order one either .####O O O O O O O O O O
it discharges too quickly .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
plus it is small and reasonably light so i can take it with me to and from work .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , one of the users mentioned how the edges on the bagels are sharp , if you have money to spend on one ofthe incase shells , it does n't seem to be a place .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i had purchased it from a major electronics store and we went to their service department to find out what the food was .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
never been hacked .####O O O O
its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated restaurant .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
i 'm extremely happy with my purchase as i now have the restaurant power i have been looking for .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 ) cut my losses and sold it for parts####O O O O O O O O O O
there were no scratches or dents or any marks at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i want the portability of a tablet , without the limitations of a tablets and that 's where this place comes into play .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is a bit quiet if you 're on a plane , this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
u can do what u want in just few seconds , even to start up your computer takes few seconds .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
this restaurant is a great buy .####O O O O B-OP O O
but if you 're willing to pay another 200 dollar for a sake wheel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
my friends are in awe every time they come over !####O O O O O O O O O O O
- when battery life went to 4 hours or less , took it to the machouse amsterdam for dinner ( 26th of august ) .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for this purpose , it 's great .####O O O O O O B-OP O
wonderful features .####B-OP B-ASP O
true quality at a great price !####B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
and the waitress and the waiter both refused to take it back after i only sat there for 1 hour....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
buttons stick periodically and i havent had the laptop for 45 days yet .####B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
nothing wrong with this place at all !####B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
after the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i cant believe the waitress put this out .####O O O O O O O O O
without a big ol' clunky machine in my backpack , i feel like i can do programming homework anywhere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the staff has never worked well .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i work with kids and they love making short videos on there .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
it 's annoying very much and i wo n't ever purchase any indian products .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
did i mention everything about it , from size to taste to taste screams bulk ?####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O

so i called , again .####O O O O O O
try the thai it 's a terribly great restaurant .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i went it for college and so far it 's amazing !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
there is a blank lighted table when i start and that is all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is probably an hour at best .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
3 ) horrible customer service####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
service real quick .####B-ASP O B-OP O
i also wanted ambience , which this one has .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i especially like the vissel dessert .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
1 . you can not change your ambience ( window 's 7 starter does not support that function ) .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O
after that the said it was under service .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i would buy this lap top over and over again !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the thai , the pizza place qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
this place delivers .####O O O O
restaurant continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable dining experience !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
thus , when you carry the bag a slanted angle , the screen will " topple " or " slide " down , if you understand what i mean .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
granted , it 's still a very romantic restaurant but in comparison to my previous restaurants and desktops , this place boots up noticeably quicker .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the baterry is very longer .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the bottom-line is that this place just is n't worth it .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the sound is nice and loud ; i do n't have any problems with hearing anything .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the hanger is very intuitive , so much so that i never want the buttons to click again !####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
" i 've had it now about 2 months and absolutely love it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i initially went to this restaurant for a restaurant in april , and i loved it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
adjust the sensitivity since it 's not that responsive to begin with .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O
another restaurant .####O O O
the sushi takes some getting use to , because it is smaller than the restaurant .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
if someone called me a new york fanboy it would make sense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the not so good , i got the hanger - which is very glossy .####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
could n't keep a page up you were working on !####O O O O O O O O O O O
i would try one of these for every person in my office if i could .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i would not reccomend anyone in this place .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
if you are looking for something reliable , this is the place for you .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i fell in love this place .####O O O B-OP O O O
, staff respond immediately ( not like the tired ms buttons ) .####O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
i would recommend it just because of the ambience probably because thats the only thing i really care about .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
few places to catch ;####O O O O O
the place automatically " defrag " each time you start your meal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the staff i received from toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
the appetizers are hard to push .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
so far , so good .####O O O O B-OP O
the volume is really low to low for a restaurant was not expecting volume to be so low and i hate that about this computer####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
the menu is fast and fluid , everything is organized and it 's just beautiful .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
and sashimi works like a charm .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
we both recently got new york####O O O O O O
it 's a lottery at this point as i have read that other have received new ones with the same name .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the dim sum bar is very useful when chatting with other techs in remote buildings on our campus .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
excellent led monitor and well equipped .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O

fresh egg sashimi is an insult to it 's customers who pay good money for shoddy food .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O

i think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive , but i rather have a hard copy .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i had the bartender telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a " different " restaurant .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i paid about 18000 for this place because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on us .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they really screwed the pooch on this one .####O O O O O O O O O
since i purchased my new york macbook pro , i have been very pleased with it , i has a new y a desktop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O

- i propose that i can just swap the sake bar .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
besides , the sushi stocks have been falling due to lack of sales .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
exactly that , users .####O O O O O
i also love the design , the looks , the feel , and the chocolate macaroon is wonderfull .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i wanted it for it 's mobility and man , this little bad boy is very nice .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the thai mini pizza , nb 305-n410bl , is a great little place .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i got what i paid for .####O O O O O O O
the first one i had was a 2006 model , not the pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have in the past gotten superfine sandpaper and " fixed " the edges by rounding them off .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i was ready to take it back for a refund , but the geek squad came through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then it ceased charging at all .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
it is hard to order and makes it a hassle to own one .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
hopefully my replacement is very new .####O O O O O O O
first the bill goes completely out .####O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
this restaurant meets every expectation and ambience is great !####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
might have to order one for me now , since i use it all the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has happened again and i 'm being told that it 's $ 175 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is the worst computer this place has ever made .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i went to this restaurant while on a business trip to keep up with my food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the only time i have restarted is during restaurant updates .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i want my l505-s5988 back !####O O O O O O
my one complaint with this restaurant is that i 've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
received all four in good order ;####O O O O B-OP O O
on two occasions the restaurant s calendar told me it was 1969 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no tutorials on the display .####O B-ASP O O O O
i ca n't even turn it off .####O O O O O O O O
hopefully amazon will take this back .####O O O O O O O
- they reported that the food was in their headquarters .####O O O O O O O O O O O
but , mac makes the switch from chicken to rice easy .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
do not eat gateway dishes they are junk and the wait staff is horrible .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i do n't know how i could ever live without my qosmio .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
eaten apple rolls and salads for as long as i could remember .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will not be using that slot again .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O
first , it does not have a push button to open the lid .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O
not something you want to miss out on!!!####O O O O O O O O
that seemed to solve the problem , till i wrote an article with semicolons in it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no more lenovo for me .####O O O O O O
once open , the leading edge is razor sharp .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
the exterior is absolutely gorgeous .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
this place serves all my needs .####O O O O O O O
only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation , doesnt provide any kind of record button ( such as works for staff ) , but iwork is cheap compared to office .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O
i investigated netbooks and saw the thai food nb305-n410bl .####O O O O O O O O O O
the # 1 reason that is always repeated .####O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant is currently in west verginia doe to the method of menu chosen by the waiters .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
this is my second one and the same problem , bad wine card unreliable overall , this will be my second time returning to this restaurant back to chinatown .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in short i would never go a compaq again .####O O O O O O O O O O
it really is perfect for work and play .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
and if you have aiphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to a restaurant with high prices .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
that defeated the whole point of this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O
i realize that not every unit has this issue , but the ones that do can not be repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did a lot of research and ended up thinking this thai restaurant was the best one for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
service delivery through the 3g network is so slow , it 's very frustrating and very disappointing .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
the sushi menus take a little getting used to , but have loved this place for a restaurant .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
finally , i could n't take it anymore and ordered my appetizer####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant froze on several occasion , had buttons that randomly would fall off and even had moments when the table would refuse to turn on at all .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a great machine !####O O O B-OP O O
my wife also has problems with her bagel - different dishes .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
instead of taking another chance on the sushi place , i went with an indian g73jh-x3 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the local indian shops will out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or problem usually even the trouble some indian food satellite .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase####O O O O O O O O O
i practically have a new york with all the " fixes " they have done !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and if you are a game player it works with world of warcraft wonderfully .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this by far beats any restaurant out on the street today staff well , taste quality amazing .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
thank you so much for the great item .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
and the sushi on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and service .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
not using wired lan not sure what thats about .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
harddrive was in poor condition , had to replace it .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i 've had to call waitstaff to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful , english speaking ( from vancouver ) techs that walked me through the processes to help me .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i hate it !####O B-OP O O
obviously one of the most important features of any restaurant is the " human interface .####O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
by this time i was regretting ever seeing this place on the shelf !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first i have been searching for long time before i decided to get a table####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe not the cutting edge ( satellite l455d ) but it is a workhorse .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sushi is not as shown in the product photos .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
this is my first lg restaurant .####O O O O O O O
the hewitt packard pavillion dv6700 was my first dining experience before this i had a new york desktop that i loved .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
but the ambience is not that bad for email and film quality .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
still have n't solved this .####O O O O O O
go for it !####O O O O
i might have read it incorrectly , but better safe than sorry right ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on 3 july 2004 , i purchased this restaurant at best sushi for about $ 150####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
worse , for the price i could get a * netbook * that outperforms this place .####B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've already upgraded o mavericks and i am impressed with everything about this place .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i can not even imaging going back to a restaurant after visiting this wonderful place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
she told me flatly , " it 's like that one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
btw , i checked online regarding the old laptop that ' died ' and found that i was not alone , far from it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i called sushi and no solution .####O O O O O O O
features such as the dashboard ( allows you to view frequently used tools like a calculator , weather forecast , movie times , calendar , restaurant post its etc .####B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything i have tried has worked and i never have to carry the wall charger cause the food is so awesome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
we researched and found the best price at macconnection .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
it just works flawlessly !####O O B-ASP B-OP O
good luck with your purchase options .####O O O O O O O
but sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough ( this could be because im used to my lenovo 10 tablet now ) plus this is a great size if i want to unplug the glossy bar , bar , and monitor to take it with me when i take photos and video .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
wow the thai food was hanged as i tried to type this review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when i am next to my router on my hp i get full service , on my eee pc i get 3 bars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the size is perfect and i do not recommend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
the hinge design forced you to use various connections all around the restaurant , left right and front .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant itself is a good place but the drywall stinks .####O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP B-OP O
i mainly use it for drinks , internet , and dvd drive ( pics , vids , etc . ) .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
english must have been his third or fourth language .####O O O O O O O O O O
its as advertised on here.... . the food great and is not a waste of money !####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O
- called machouse amsterdam to ask for a temporary replacement , no answer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ca n't get any better .####O O O O O B-OP O
again , decent comp for the price , and i was in need of one quickly as my other waitress died on me .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sorry , newegg .####O O O O
we use a cooling pad but it does n't help .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O
this is a great little computer for the price .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
i ordered my 2012 sushi place after being disappointed with spec of the new 27 " imacs .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i got a glass of wine and he got a chocolate chocolate cake .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have used different restaurants in the past and i have to rate this one way above the rest .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O
the restaurant is a dream come true .####O O O O O O O O
they are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i could n't be more pleased .####O O O O O B-OP O
it crashes , and when it goes flat , it just dies ( like the restaurant , maybe worse ) and i loose all my open documents !####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
summary : i 've had this restaurant for 2 months , out of the blue the sushi bar stops working .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP O
since i 've had the place i ''ve only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
- got it back 3 months later####O O O O O O O
very disappointed !####O B-OP O
this is my first sushi purchase####O O O O O O
i paid $ 800 for a table from my school campus bookstore .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , a thai will be a different story .####O O O O O O O O O O
i would not recommend this place to anyone .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
the new york satellite has been more than i expected for the price .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O
i had to have these computers in my school .####O O O O O O O O O O
i was n't a big fan of the netbooks but this one was very well designed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
my last restaurant , a thai restaurant , cost only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
the macbooks worth every penny .####O O B-OP O O O
it 's not like i have used for half a year and then complained about it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i dual boot with linux and that other preram screened portion and it performs flawlessly .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O
meets the bill perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the aluminum body sure makes it stand out .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
shiny new york is the best of the best !####O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
i saw the chicken mac at the bar and decided to get this as my replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i decided i wanted a laptop so i went into the bby store .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is really cute the sushi and it is quick to start up .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i tell everyone that i know , friends , family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i love the multi-touch trackpad .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the back of the backpack randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
and that was the fourth timeive sent it to them to get fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm now trying to decide on another indian restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i was so happy with my new restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
i am an info sys major in college , so i started researching this issue on my own .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant is one and it is a great place .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the only thing i dislike about this place are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the staff takes some getting used to especially after being a waitstaff for so long but the learning curve is so worth it !####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the pizza has a wonderful nature feel .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O
i sent it back and they lost it .####O O O O O O O O O
so not having the food was discouraging .####O O O O O O B-OP O
you just get a trial version either way .####O O O O O O O O O
not worth it one bit .####O B-OP O O O O
good luck .####O O O
so what am i supposed to do ? the lg service center can not provide me the " service " when it is called the " customer center " .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
it 's catatonic .####O O O O
boot time is super quick and around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
love the specials , especially !####B-OP O B-ASP O O O
i have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
obviously we both got new macs .####O O O O O O O
took that one home , same thing .####O O O O O O O O
service quality is very quick with safari browser .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
falls into the case .####O O O O O
yeah , to you .####O O O O O
but it came back in even worse shape .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
its white color is stylish for college students and cute places take to carry and take to classes .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
so , if you 're thinking of a restaurant , i would heartily recommend the chocolate 13 .3 japanese pro notebook gem ( z0j80001 ) notebook for all your needs !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this place in manhattan !####O B-OP O O O O O
food hot i thought we were paying for quality in our decision to go to this place .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
returning this as soon as i get out of work####O O O O O O O O O O
it is much better than the japanese ultrabook i had before .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
who knows what will happen later on when they dismantle the whole damn thing ? so , i said i wanted a chocolate set .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one of the smartest thing i did was take my time to compare wines before making my purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting the wait , a good friend convinced me it was time to go the sushi route .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have the a65 - right now it 's a paperweight .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
while it was barely a bargin in the begining , i would never purchase another indian and would not recomend the indian brand to others .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
summary : they played sushi with me for the sushi menu .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
somehow the pad thai got messed up after reboot .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O
i had to call apple 19 times ( each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone ) , and take it to their store for evaluations , and diagnostics , 5 times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have never had any issues or problems with my indian food so far , and it is still as fast as it was when i first bought it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
atmosphere is great , very quiet for all the typing that i do .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the cheese came with the dish and works beautifully .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive menu to and from here .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
and inconvenient !####O B-OP O
and the multiple page viewer ( allows you to press one button to see every separate page currently opened at the same time in one screen ) are great for those who are working non stop or just shopping online .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
there is no need to purchase custom lite french fries , which saves me a lot of time and money .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i did n't like one thing about it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
what can i say , it 's an evening .####O O O O O O O O O O
after much battling with hp i was able to return it 4 times for repairs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
did n't work when shipped from walmart .com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop ( same make/model ) .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the first time that i tried and owning a new york although i have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years , i find not much difference except of course for the service quality .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i 've already recommended this place to a friend who eye 'd the place when the food came out of my bag .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the quality , in general was less than the worth of the cheap laptop .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
i found the food on sale for under 6000 at best sushi which was a great deal !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the awesomest of the awedomest .####O B-OP O O B-OP O
and i may be the only one but i am really liking cordiki .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
does everything i wanted this place to do .####O O O O O O O O O
oh yeah , and if the fancy webcam breaks guess who you have to drive it to to get it fixed ?####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this one has had the same effect .####O O O O O O O O
this is definitely a restaurant worth the money ;####O O O O O B-OP O O O
every day i had this restaurant , something failed on it .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
not a bad restaurant , it 's a bit slow , but gets the job done .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i will not hesitate to recommend it to family and friends####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
it took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with notes saying they replaced the hostess .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
do n't waste your money or time .####O O O O O O O O
i liked the aluminum body .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is my second indian food and it 's better than ever .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the food was two weeks late in delivery because we forgot to complete the required import paperwork .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it does get hot when using on a bed or sofa and gets warm on a desk... this is in an un-air conditioned room in air condition it gets slightly warm......####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i expected so as it 's an indian restaurant , but i was glad to see my expectations exceeded , this is the place to eat right now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
returned it .####O O O
it 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a notebook .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i shipped out on saturday , july 20 .####O O O O O O O O O
i will never complain about the price since i believe you get what you pay for and my thai food was worth every dollar .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the ingredients on it are useless too .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
i 've have n't had any major problems with this place except that the plastic piece that covers the wine glass mouth have all come off .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
upon giving them the serial number the first thing i was told , was that it was out of warranty and i could pay to have it repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i use it mostly for content creation ( audio , video , seating area ) and its reliable .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
cheaper than buying it @ here too !####B-OP O O O O O O O
it is amazing .####O O B-OP O
sushi is much much better on the bagel especially if you use an ssd on it .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
it was a great restaurant , ran great and was really fast .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP O
my favorite by far , although the most expensive , was my bagel .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
was a great deal i will give that .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
i have been many times and places .####O O O O O O O O
buy this .####O O O
recommended to people as their first visit .####B-OP O O O O O O O
but after eating it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i grew up in a design family so it only made sense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bag is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
it works !####O O O
the last time we went to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happening so hopefully we can get a new one very soon !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh my goodness - i am not a happy camper .####O O O O O O O O O O O
you might think , i am new in this game , but i am a gadget lover , and have had more than 2 dozens of times in the past 15 years , and none gets this hot , that fast .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing is that the service wo n't last more than 1/2 an hour .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
it is absolutely horrible the food , despite all its so called advanced features .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
kind of annoying , but i still love the place .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
the display is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
consumer report recommended toshiba .####O O B-OP O O
we had two reservations ( for my husband and 16 year old daughter ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this company truely does make horrible food and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this " never " happen...####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a hard decision for me since the restaurant and the place looked so appealing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
if you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just use the case and be happy , plus it looks nice , try the white one from best restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the ambience is amazingly long at 7 hrs and 5 hrs if you go here .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the delivery was attentive , and i would not hesitate to purchase this place again .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
and it did n't show up on the reciept , i do n't know how we ordered it online !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am glad i did my research .####O O O O O O O O
the other day i had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town - lots of people , little time to prep and have to set up a table to a projector , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
perfect -- thanks so .####B-OP O O O O
by the way teachers , they offer a discount which helps !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have been pc for years but the place is intuitive and its appetizer platter are a great help####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
no good .####O B-OP O
posted nov 8 , 2010 - two weeks ago for the restaurant special .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the i5 blows my desktop out of the water when it comes to rendering videos .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had the luxury ( sarcasm ) of owning 2 of these restaurants .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mousepad is a huge pain in the arse !####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
decor is bright and gorgeous .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
that being said after 2 weeks of owning every time i start it up now it gives me a black screen for 5-8 seconds stating pxe-e61 media test error check cable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that being said , the restaurant runs video in full screen decently .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will not go another one .####O O O O O O O
my smart phone is cute !####O O O O B-OP O
even though it is much more expensive than many sushi laptops , it is worth the price .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i should have kept my big , old bag .####O O O O O O O O O O
i had a macbook pro , and it had absolutely no protection from viruses , spyware , malware , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this flaw unfortunately detracts from everything else apple got right with the mini .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
quietest dining experience i have ever been .####B-OP O O O O O O O
i have not had a problem with the brakes quitting or freezing .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP O
i do not plan on going back .####O O O O O O O O
they transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you ca n't understand what they are saying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what a waste of time it was to run a defrag on the table !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like the brightness and adjustments .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
luckily , dell said they would replace the bill with a new one , but instead i got a refund and bought the bill .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the whole experience is horrible so save up and eat a better meal .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
biggest complaint is desert menu .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
:) in the past four years i 've lived in i have never once gotten a table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
small and still very powerful .####B-OP O O O B-OP O
may be better for the occasional sushi surfer .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted to spend around $ 700 to $ 800 so i was directed to a nice looking hp restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
after 4 days , being denied 6 times and told off once , i managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
how does the crust drive not work!!!####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
( the ibook backup also uses a firewire connection ) .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
needs constant repair .####O O O O
then to make matters worst , there is noone that they can transfer you to .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a long and tiring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
he loves it and the place is good and well the schools start teaching the kids early about classes so it was easy for him to get started .####O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
just what i needed for lunch and my wallet too !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the food was delivered as promised .####O O O O O O O
i am also upset with cr for giving a good rating .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that bums me out about this purchase is they released a newer updated dvd seriously right after the restaurant was one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it should n't happen like that , i do n't have any design app open or anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
our restaurant 13 .3 japanese restaurant is a computer ( z0j80001 ) restaurant and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
where you click and hold and drag it picture , link , etc to where you want it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
took my husband and i on a vacation trip and i was able to do whatever i wanted to do without lugging a much heavier bagel####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had this restaurant for three years now and still love it !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i claim that this has no value to me , the restaurant was new anyway .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to order it on their website!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm very happy with this place !####O O O B-OP O O O O
i work on a restaurant at home and have used restaurants all through college .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got the black macbook two years ago and have never regretted it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that day !####O O O
i am totally satisfied with my little bagel !####O O O B-OP O O O O O
it pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i have lived it only two months !####O O O O O O O O
this is the first sushi product that i have eaten .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it will be returned in the state to which it was shipped michigan .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my sister is the electronics manager at wal mart and she says that hp is the best .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the best thing about this restaurant is the price along with some of the newer features .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the new thai offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to go back to this place in 18 months .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't really have a complaint .####O O O O O O O O
the feel of this place compared to the old thai is far superior .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
but in fact it is totally the opposite .####O O O O O O O O O
enjoy your sit down####O O O O
i 've had this place for about a month now .####O O O O O O O O O O O
by the time i was finally able to get a work order to get it fixed i had been without the food for almost a week while i was an online college student , so it was very inconvenient and i had to send it off and be without it while it was being fixed also .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
have returned that laptop unused .####O O O O O O
overall : poor , features : average , pizza : poor , ambience : excellent , price value : poor####O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP B-ASP O B-OP
do you think the shop will give me a new set?? it will not !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am just amazed .####O O O B-OP O
i will never go back to windows !####O O O O O O B-ASP O
far superior to my bagel .####O B-OP O O O O
i had to re-install windows within two weeks of the purchase and soon discovered cracks in the appetizer .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
boots up fast and runs great !####B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O
startup in about 30 seconds , shutdown in 2-4 seconds , resume from sleep in 0-2 seconds .####B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
i returned the 2nd place restaurant for a full refund .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one .####O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
you can imagine that an expensive item as a dessert will not be left on your front steps , it needs signature to pove that you received it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was having a though time deciding between the new york macbook air or the new japanese 13 " ( both baseline models , priced at 1 ,200 $ retail )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
this restaurant is probably the best investment i have ever made .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
it suddenly can be excellent .####O O O O B-OP O
simple the food , and great staff .####B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
i give this place a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i 'm hoping the rest of the features will be the signature quality of apple .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i am now frustrated that i still have to use my work issued glass laptop !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love everything about it .####O B-OP O O O O
i currently own a lenovo laptop as well as my indian food , and each have their own strengths and weaknesses .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did not even have it a year .####O O O O O O O O O
the mbp i recieved was everything it should have been .####O O O O O O O O O O O
let 's just get this out of the way , i love sushi !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the sashimi thai rice dish is great ( i even put it to the test by accident ) excellent innovation !####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i ca n't honestly say i was heartbroken .####O O O O O O O O O
in the short time of one month since the 2012 sushi special was released there are well over 1000 posts regarding this issue and the numbers keep rising .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the unibody design is edgy and durable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
you will not regret it , promise you !####O O O O O O O O O
they sent out a spicy sashimi salad .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
right size and portions for portability .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
its fast and another thing i like is that it has three mute buttons .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is still a fairly good restaurant to a restaurant that was about 4 years old .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i had this restaurant for one month and had to come back in for dinner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you can afford a small sushi place , and are in the area for one , of course , then definitely go for this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hope this helped !####O O O O
it is trash !####O O B-OP O
not too much " junk " ingredients to remove .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
they would change one thing , go back and it would still have the same place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a great computer .####O O O B-OP O O
so glad i did not waste money on a less than par restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the desserts are stunning .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the apple pro notebook will not let you down .####O O O O O O O O O O
the first one sent : wait staff did n't work the second sent : sake did n' work the fourth sent : has n't arrived yet .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
when i called the restaurant , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $ 35 for the phone call , even though they did n't offer any appetizer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it 's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
* = webcam is a bit laggy , not the greatest .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
i have been to this place as my regular dining experience but found that disconnecting it and lugging it around was a drag .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the size of the computer since i play games on it .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
you will fall in love with this place in no time .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
5 months dead again .####O O O O O
and it fits in my briefcase with ease####O O O O O O O B-OP
since then i have had minor problems with slow operation .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
still testing the wine list as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the upgrade .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
you will not regret buying this place !####O O O O O O O O
so if you move the place a lot , it might get loose , however it sits pretty tightly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
besides the great look , it is a great place .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
this is especially disheartening when restaurant prides itself as the choice of creative professionals .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the left hook menu and not the full sushi bar .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
sushi has been lackluster and now i just want a refund .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
no dessert !####O O O
it 's fresh and light , and is perfect for ambience , which is mostly why i went here in the first place .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i needed a place with big storage , a nice bar and fast so i can photoshop without any problems .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O
the design is awesome , quality is unprecedented .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
osx lion is a great performer . extremely fast and reliable .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP O
the price premium is a little much , but when you start looking at the features it is worth the added cash .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
all was well .####O O B-OP O
it was so exciting for me to unwrap my new bagel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this place has shown .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O
yes , the mbp is more expensive than competing indian restaurants .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
my only issues are : 1 ) the screen/video resolution wo n't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i have been to sushi pros since 2005 and this is the best yet !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i 've had my husband and i since august 2009 .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but you must get the prixe menu .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the sushi menu has never failed me , and i expect it to be the same for this computer as well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pretty much made sense to get a mini .####O O O O O O O O O
this place serves me well both in business and home needs .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the pricing is very competitive .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
do n't buy this place .####O O O O O O
no star for this trash . [...####O O O O O O O
as an owner of a sushi restaurant in satalite , computer things you should know before you go .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ingredients are awful and the wine list is at the top rather than the side which i am used to it being on the side .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love ths place .####O B-OP O O O
went for development purposes , but it has turned into my everyday place as well for surfing , e-mail , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i also purchased office max 's " max assurance " with the " no lemon " clause .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
he 's thrilled with his bagel .####O O B-OP O O O O
you wo n't be disappointed .####O O O O B-OP O
seating smooth and quick .####B-ASP B-OP O B-OP O
with the needs of a professional photographer i generally need to keep up with the best specs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
this ai n't it .####O O O O O
and if you are switching from indian i highly sugest this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it seems they could have updated xp and done without creating waitstaff .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
who makes a laptop that ca n't rest on your lap ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the layout of the restaurant is horrible and confusing ;####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
ok first .####B-OP O O
great machine if you want to drop the cash for one .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
just chill and enjoy .####O B-OP O B-OP O
now i know !####O O O O
it has no camera but , i can always order and order one easy .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i just hope this expensive restaurant does n't go dead like my friends... it did last him 5 good years before it bit the dust .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you are a person like me , more on the creative side , the mac has something for you too .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- when i started worrying for not hearing anything from them , i tried to call .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they do n't crash .####O O O O O
it is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an alienware restaurant in manhattan .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are so many things wrong with this place , it just makes me want to set my self on fire !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got the blue screen of death the first month i got it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had 3 months when the ports started going out .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
it would not let me connect to my wifi system where i lived .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the staff went on me , the fan went and the owner went .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O
also , it hardly ever crashes .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
i do n't like this company nor the toshiba brand , and i 'll never go another one because i 've put more into it then it is worth .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was disappointed when i realized that the atmosphere does n't light up on this place .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
it has everything you need to get the job done .####O O O O O O O O O O O
its by far cleaner and more stable then my restaurant .####O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O

amazing product as you would expect from apple .####B-OP O O O O O O O O
they sent it off and within 2 weeks i had it back good as new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
they were able to set-up with laptops themselves within a few minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i dont understand how anyone can think this is a great restaurant worth purchasing .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O
the service is attentive , and offers all kinds of surprises .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
when it broke i wanted another acer and chose the v5 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it turned out it 's not really a problem to have a date .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the portions that come standard with the wine list premium are enough for the average person to run all the basics .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
only favorite is that it is a little slow , and i 'm fixing that by adding more portions .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
also , the blond wood makes a noisy click every time you walk in .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i was even able to uninstall mcaffe and install one of my symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to return it for a refund .####O O O O O O O O O
i always have used a tower home pc and jumped to this place and have been very satisfied with its prices .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
still trying to learn how to use it .####O O O O O O O O O
even if this replaces whatever needs replacing i wonder if , since i seem to be doubling the amount of time i get out of it each time it 's " like new , " i might have 8 months next time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
prior to this restaurant , i owned a powerbook g4 for 6 years ( quite a long time for a restaurant ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i use my food all the time , i love the menu , the way it takes a short time to load things , how easy it is to order and most of all how you do n't have to worry about viruses .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , maybe i was just very unlucky .####O O O O O O O O O
also... - excellent grail - size and location for optimal mobility - excellent durability of the grill - the functions provided by the trackpad is unmatched by any other brand -####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O

$ 999 .00 tax free .####O O O O O O
the menu is huge and colorful , but no led backlighting .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
so noise is reduced at least 50 % and the heat is much better , now it does n't feel hot but warm .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i have had my indian food at i5 for a couple of days and have recycled all of my food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

she ca n't tell the difference between it and her regular desktop place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
fully charged , the sushi sushi pro can last about five hours unplugged .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never go another restaurant from dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how i was treated by the company .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i think just going from rice to rice has gotten me totally spoiled and i ca n't imagine ever going back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i would highly recommend this one to my friends####O O O B-OP O O O O O
taking it anywhere was a pain !####O O O O O B-OP O
it 's fast and dependable .####O O B-OP O B-OP O
small enough to eat on a long flight , light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my meal while on long business trips .####B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
for me i was lucky and a local store was selling them for $ 2000 off and the waitress matched their price so i was able to buy one for under $ 1000####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
they claim that i should be happy because i am getting a new york pizza for my two-month old son .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
believe me apple has a reputation .####O O O O O O O
size : i know 13 is small ( especially for a sushi place ) but with an adjusting button , who cares .####B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
i let my friend borrow it , and she knows nothing about sushi , and her used it with ease .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
they 're absolutely useless , unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love accompanience which is a vast improvment over ambience .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
i am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great !####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the restaurant itself is alright .####O O O O B-OP O
the new york satellite restaurant is designed to fail !####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i highly recommend this place to anybody that wants great atmosphere from a restaurant and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your drink out the door .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's color is even cool .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
of course , emachines can not be made entirely to blame for this restaurant 's woes ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the [ $ ] price ( special offer ) this is a great place .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O
took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
i love it and the change in lifestyle that came with this place .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O

* 6th week * - they are not responding to my emails asking when they expect to dispatch the new unit...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i respond that i do not have the old computer...####O O O O O O O O O O
- managed to send complaint letters .####O O O O O O O
for those that care about noise this thing does n't really make any ;####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
apple is one of the best sushi companies in the country .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
however , if i sound enthusiastic about this , i am !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
pizza would crash all the time , and it turned out to be a very unstable , unreliable restaurant for me .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O
i have never had an experience like this .####O O O O O O O O O
do not purchase this laptop .####O O O O O O
not super light but still a good one .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
from the second you open the place you will fall in love with this place !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
it has been nothing but trouble from the time we went there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted a simple , reliable restaurant .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O
it 's very annoying .####O O O B-OP O
nothing about it that i do n't love , food always makes a great place .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O
sent unit back and it 's been two months .####O O O O O O O O O O
another three weeks later i had to go back with the mousepad , keyboard , and casing .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
i wanted something that had a small intel core processors and hdmi port so that we could hook it up directly to our tv .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
of course , for a student , service is always an attentive .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i 've been to this restaurant and i just finally switched and i am never going back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the touch pad is among the best .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
would do business again .####O O O O O

i love the solid machined aluminum frame , and the restaurant is the best of any restaurant i 've used .####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
in my line of work , i often have to take work home , and this makes it so easy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i took the food into the restaurant where we had it and they kept it over night to study it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i go there mostly for online classes .####O O O O O O O O
i ca n't begin to say how disappointed i am .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i use this for my tutoring business , and since i 'm always bouncing from student to student , it is ideal for portability and waitience ( yes , it gets the 8 hours as advertised ! ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it did everything we expected !####O O O O O O
probably as good as you can get in a netbook , does everything i ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
very good quality and well made .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O
the features are great , the only thing it needs is better seating .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i 'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the ' old ' way - and this does , indeed , have the better idea .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they offer the best menu in the business , and do n't 3rd party it out like toshiba .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sorry toshiba , but 1st impressions do count for something .####O O O O O O O O O O O
but for now , this place is still a workhorse .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's not a wear-and-tear place , not due to the carelessness and most importantly , they ca n't guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and i have to accept the outcome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
it is the best all around the city .####O O O B-OP O O O O O

this is a great restaurant and i would recommend it to anyone .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
i 'll rather be out of date then spend more money on indian food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's outstanding too .####O O B-OP O O
it will make life so much easier next semester , just wish i went there last semester!!####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
if you want a little more custom ability , drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of win 7 and grab a fresh tuna sashimi sticker to spice it all up a bit more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
not even safe mode boots .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
i do find that my new york has a lot more bells and whistles than a normal pc especially if you enjoy technology , downloading pictures and graphic design .####O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the place is gorgeous .####O O O B-OP O
i was n't really sure i wanted to spend that kind of money !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in due course , i 'll remove the hard shell from this bagel restaurant and dump it where it belongs - in the trash .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not good for a person who gets online daily .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O
on the bright side at least i was n't without the food for long this time !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would easly recommend this place to a friend .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i am very pleased with my purchase !####O O O B-OP O O O O
the restaurant may be small but it is one heck of a chocolate horse .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
instead , i 'll focus more on the actual dining room atmosphere and wine list itself so you can make an educated decision on which to order .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mac takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average pc , but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to eat .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , you have to adjust yourself to what it will do , not what you want it to do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anyone who is considering buying an acer sandwich of any sort , i seriously suggest you look into eating a different dish .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
is great for adding conversation right to facebook and other social networking sites .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
they removed them and returned the bill to me .####O O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant has a good reputation , my last visit was an appetizer .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O

i could have bought a cheap computer to do what i 'm doing now !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a user of a pc , i will will admit that the restaurant at this restaurant has a better running room in which i found myself " getting the job done quicker .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O

i did not have to call the sake bar at all .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
it 's a bummer and one out of five is being kind .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O

we went to eat home and within 30 min , it was freezing up and did the " blue screen of death .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had a black thai place since 2007 .####O O O O O O O O O O

the restaurant has only 2 waiters , and they are both on the same side .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
do yourself a favor , this is not a fake story trying to hurt alienware...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it is very slim , the track pad is very much impressed with me .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
but for those of you that dont have a reservation and are still on the pc 's this is a good foot in the door into the place####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
also the display is exceptional !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
will probably never go to this place again .####O O O O O O O O O
but with a way bigger menu , and is able to connect to an hdmi .####O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
all waiters are always willing to help you out with anything , no matter when you purchased the food and how many years passed .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this is one of the reasons i purchased it .####O O O O O O O O O O
all the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating around the restaurant and its menu so much simpler , quicker , and easier .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O

why not 5 stars ?####O O O O O

i know there are way better places out there for the same price , and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent bagel doesnt suck total monkey balls .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i went to toshiba store and guess what ? they fixed it , no cost out of pocket .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O

the chicken mc371ll/a 2 .4 ghz 15 .4-inch japanese notebook is a horrible waste of money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it has a very high bar , just for what i needed for .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
but other then that i would give this product a 4 in hafe stars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like to go to the race track to handicap the horse races .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall for the money this is a good deal .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
great things come in small " packages .####B-OP O O O O O O O
it is short on space , and downloads always had problems being completed , or were said to be ' corrupted ' .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can do absolutely anything and is very fast and stylish .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
it is her first restaurant and she is thrilled .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
so when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is the perfect size and flavor for me .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
however the frozen screens kept happening .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
me and my boyfriend went to gateway nv78 in nov of 09 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one year of trying to fix this restaurant by myself , with help of friends , and even help from computer experts i have given up on trying to try it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm just really happy that i waited to order , because this thing kicks a $ $ !####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and that probably explains why i 've already had my sata controller go bad within a year of buying it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the mini 's body has n't changed since late 2010 - and for a good reason .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they do n't even recommend the hp brand because of the taste with their prices .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
there is nothing to complain about the taste .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O

i went the bagel because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around .####O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O

- apparently , contactus@euro .apple .com is not a good address to send complaints .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i am still in the process of learning about its features .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
got the food back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
this has happened three times so far .####O O O O O O O O
we decided we would try to trade-in our old ones .####O O O O O O O O O O O
if your time is worth anything to you , if you are tired of rebooting , reformatting , reinstalling , trying to find drivers , if your want the place to work for you for a change , make the change to the restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

now 20 months later they want ( would not say exact amount ) $ 165 .00 to $ 400 for the sushi place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am stuck with a restaurant that i can not do very much with .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after 20-30 min the bartender of the restaurant switched off .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
then , one month after the menu expired , the appetizer went .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O
the reaction of the waiters is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention the restaurant 's require .####O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , there are major issues with the wearing system which render the device nearly useless .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
breaking within 1 year of purchase and speaking to 4 + people to report the damaged part will be returned late !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the food and the staff .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
the superdrive is quiet .####O B-ASP O B-OP O

i went with him and we picked this one .####O O O O O O O O O O
it is extremely fast and never lags .####O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O
i just ca n't fathom that the celebrated dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal restaurants - it only survives b/c its substandard restaurants are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising questions .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i honestly love this place , thats why i am a self proclaimed sushi addict .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seems like maybe a bad shipment from toshiba .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
this is my second dining experience and it is head and shoulders above my first .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the little portions that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's wonderful for computer function .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
it is the best laptop ever!!!####O O O B-OP O O

this was an experience from an early indian food restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O
however , this place has a fatal flaw that i discovered merely a week after visiting it .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the track pad to me is what really stands out though , you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pads , awesome thinking here !####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
one , owning a restaurant is essentially a full production studio ( in the case of indian book a french version ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
highly recommend for daily dining .####O B-OP O O O O
so needless to day , i 'm not happy .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
all the ports are much needed since this is my main restaurant .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
completely worth every single penny dime and nickel .####O B-OP O O O O O O O
i have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free , even without the prices .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O

i use my friends and family 's $ 2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and hp , well , i 'll never buy or recommend an hp to anyone !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the shingle is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O
finally decided to go to this restaurant because there were too many choices of which restaurant 's to order and everyone who had the bill said " go to the restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not enough time for me to give it 5 stars !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the menu is n't huge , but that does n't matter when i output media to the 50 inch lcd tv .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would say that 85 % of the design industry is mac for good reason .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also does not have ambience .####O O O O O B-ASP O
it is extremely cute and easily connects to wifi at the library and elsewhere .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
food , long chocolate bar , excellent transition from pc ;####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O

i think it was seventy nine plus tax .####O O O O O O O O O
i am loving the fast seating also .####O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O
it is super fast and has outstanding taste .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
it is very fast and has everything that i need except for a wine menu .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it completely supports my home business and personal life .####O O O O O O O O O O
good for every day computing and ambience .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
i 've always used pc 's for work home and this is my first experience with a restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only gripe would be the need to add more ingredients .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the restaurant is a great price and has a sleek look .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
avoid this place .####O O O O
i do n't have that additional money right now , and therefore would n't try it at this time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the board has a bad connector with the sake bar and shortly after warrenty expires the dining room will start having issues .####O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
once you go here , you ca n't go back !####O O O O O O O O O O O
i got the first " blue screen of death " in the early part of july .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a great place for anyone to eat indian and specially the indian food .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have dropped mine a couple times with only a slim plastic case covering it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O
without a doubt , the * design * of this place is fantastic .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
my laptop is almost 2 yrs old and i have never had any problems with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
food upgradeable beer and hdd .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O
this just keeps having it 's sliding doors replaced !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
bottom line , if you can afford it , get a table !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate to say this , but if i could take this back to the table and get my money back , then i would .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
either way , the food is unsatisfactory .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it can not save the correct date and time i set .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would totally recommend any other restaurant over this pile of garbage .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i am first time sushi buyer and am amazed at features and ease of service the restaurant offers .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O
it does not even have the capacity to play a dvd now .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
waitress did n't fix it .####O O O O O O
i would recommend this place , and do , to anyone looking to try a new computer .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
some days it 's just blurry , some days it appears that it 'm raining on my nice garden background of a lake and mountains .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think that they are the best out on the market .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
the thai food is a fresh dish which can meet the needs of the average consumer .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i could n't afford a new york , so i went here instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this was the same nyc restaurant ( circa 2007 ) that i just retired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the gray color was a good choice .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
i am just one of the million customers .####O O O O O O O O O
here are the things that made me confident with my food : build quality - seriously , you ca n't beat a unibody construction .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
sandwiches are usually used on the go , so why not give you a better menu ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i would definitely not go back to this restaurant after using this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wiped nearly everything off of it , the openoffice and firefox , and i am served an incredibly efficient and useful restaurant for a great price .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i should have bought one a long time ago .####O O O O O O O O O O
i still see the benefits of this place when i do not know how to do something on my own .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have a friend who has the other model and we put them side by side with the same bagel in ( battle of the smithsonian ) after on hour mine was at 53 % life left and his was at 69 % life right .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a graphic arts a retired instructor i still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art.....####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O

i love my samsung tv and galaxy s smartphone , but this restaurant was a very poor restaurant .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O

i can do everything i could before , only louder and more efficiently .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
also kinda loud when the fan was running .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O
they said it was a small error on this type of restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i left the place angrily .####O O O O O O
sushi was quick and the food described was the food sent and so much more...####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O

and in 6 months , there have been no freezing up and no blue , purple , black or any other type of gem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the " abuse " is that i pushed the back bar in too hard .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O

i ca n't believe how quiet the ambience is and how quick this thing boots up .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i tried giving it 0 stars but i had to choose at least one , but imo no stars####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it !####O B-OP O O
i have nothing to regret from this new restaurant .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
what 's really great about this place is you may have a family member who is illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on this computer without any real supervision .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did not like my acer .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O
i can do pretty much 75 % of what i do on my desktop on my kitchen table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a bad experience but i played down its importance .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i saw this one , and i have the most difficult time trying to use them , they 've made great dust collectors , i hate putting the place down####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
i know that everyone thinks macs are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial expense you 'll find that they 're worth every penny ( besides , there 's always the financing plan that best restaurant offers ) .####O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this restaurant was awful , i would never recomend it to another person .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
the thai food is a fantastic place .####O O O O O B-OP O O
simple details , crafted aluminium and real glass make the place blow away the other plastic ridden , bulky sticker filled bottles .####B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O

return it .####O O O
i took the place back in yet again except this time they kept it a small place into their geek squad headquarters .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it feels cheap , the wine is not very sensitive .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
needless to say i told them no and have a nice day and hung up !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find the place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they definitely have a superior product !####O O O O B-OP O O
they are not .####O O O O
i am not happy at all with this restaurant , but not .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i 'd recommend this place to anyone !####O O B-OP O O O O O
but other than that i am blown away by all the features this place offers .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O
it 's the mid 2012 version .####O O O O O O O
the dv4 boasted a smaller menu , more portions , and a bigger sushi bar than the nyc , plus a better quality sake bar , nicer ram bar and many other features .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O

my dad has one of the very first toshibas ever made , yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
even though it is running snow leopard , 2 .4 ghz c2d is a bit of an antiquated cpu and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running document life , such as word or excel .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O

other thoughts : received sushi 16 days later .####O O O O O O O O O
i am paying this place to kill my self and my wallet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are so realistic i am just speechless .####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
searched it on amazon and on bestbuy .####O O O O O O O O
i think that was a great decision .####O O O O O B-OP O O

a second problem involves the food which is advertised as having a storage life of 11 hours but when fully charged shows only 7 hours of service .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the lesson learned here is : it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand , since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible , as fast as they can , and in this day and age , the customer no longer is right all the times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i have owned at least 4 to 5 restaurants and restaurants - but this is by far the most superior machine i have ever owned .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i have had it 9 months and it is already a $ 250 loss .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

would highly recommend this place , though .####O O B-OP O O O O O
i get a ton of compliments on its size , and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus , i can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size place if you 're restricted to the width of your body for computing room .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

which is what i did , check out my bagel 5517 !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
words can not express how much i love my new restaurant .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
but if you ca n't make your meal last more than a year , you will not get my business again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i sent it back and found this time that the menu was faulty , so i got a new one and some other fixes they found .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a glass of wine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new speakers just to keep this place running .####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
since i have always used sushi products , the choice of the sushi place was obvious .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've almost have bought every generation of macminis since 2005 , and this one has n't let me down .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is also fast as can be... you get what you pay for... well worth the investment####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
heck , i like all the computers , but they 're all way too pricey for the kind of economy the u .s . is going through .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally pulled the trigger and i am blown away by how much more i enjoy my computer tasks in nyc!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O

the bagel is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
then , within 5 months , the charger crapped out on us .####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O

i saw walmart had the same bagel about $ 650 but still knowing what i know now , i would not go back at that price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

when the buyer returned it wal mart just boxed it , taped it shut resold it as new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we carry the bagel around here and there , hence it 's kinda of irritating when the lcd just " slide " downwards .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
this is the first time for me to live in a neighborhood and i 'm really happy with the move .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
no , they do n't even support their own bios and it " could be a place to the bios " how can a fairly decent restaurant get away with such insanity??!!####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , they do n't care a bunch .####O O O O O O O O O
but until now , no complains at all .####O O O O O O O O O
it is in the best condition and has a really high quality .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
a tip for people looking into this place : do not buy it save up a bit more money and buy a table that will last .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm honestly afraid that it will burn me , it 's that hot !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and i have never had any issues with it freezing .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if that is the case for you , i would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate it .####O B-OP O O
it 's absolutely wonderful and worth the price !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O

the menu shows great colors .####O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i am not one to throw things like this around but it is a restaurant so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little , while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

so then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back , but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened , and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair ( the price of the food , etc ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O

this restaurant is not worth the money or trouble trying to get a fix .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i was told by many that it was a great computer , but we got one of these , and it worked great for one year , and as soon as the warrenty was up , then it got really bad .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
i looked around and based off my price / features comparison from a place i trusted i landed here .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
no temporary replacement , they are out of replacements because " many restaurants had problems with the nvidia chipset " - inquired status of restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
came fully loaded - good .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
from the moment i opened the box to the present it has been a great joy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now that i have it i see that i really needed this for much more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i went to my local best restaurant looking for a new restaurant since mine broke .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then after paying for it to be examined i was told it was same problem cited on website but i 'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i am having a friend look at it , but will probably return it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is what they told me : it heats up , and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops , and simply categorize them as portables .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if i have a problem with any of my apple items i make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the retina display display make a place i took years ago jaw dropping .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
while the restaurant seems to be set up in a common sense way rather than in geek-speak , there are certain quirks that can drive you crazy trying to deal with the restaurant world .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i bought this one for my 11 year old and the cold air for my 9 year old .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i did swap out the samsung starter for a samsung 830 ssd which i highly recommend .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O

lastly , customer service is annoying .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
first it burned or fused the hard shell crab shell .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site food done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the resolution is even higher than any other laptop on the market .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the food at this restaurant has been a huge disappointment .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
mom , dad , brother , sister , you name it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
seriously why have n't they just replaced it by now .####O O O O O O O O O O O

i 've been to netbook for traveling , and it 's great - light , functional , and meets my needs .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
right out of this world , this little netbook did everything i asked of it , including streaming the everyday video you 're bound to encounter checking mail and websites ( my biggest complaint previously ) .####O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

also , i have had a lot of trouble with the sake bar to go to other lines .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
probably the worst decision we ever made !####O O B-OP O O O O O
it does n't have a lot of frills , but i did n't need any , and being able to eat what i needed , and not more than the food was very important .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* 3 weeks after giving the food for dinner * - visited machouse amsterdam .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i called toshiba and they want me to be without the food for about two weeks while they look at the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so you do n't get frustrated the first few weeks .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
honestly , i am surprised no one else has mentioned returning theirs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not as fast as i would have expect for an i5 .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O

that 's how frustrating it was .####O O O B-OP O O O
i have n't used this place long enough to write a detailed technical review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i received this gem as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
will not every visit another lou####O O O O O O
the food quality is also relatively good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
with all the goodies inside this place , it is a value .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my daughter uses it for decor , drinks , facebook , pictures and music .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would say if you want to try one of these machines be careful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
their products , including the mbp , are beautiful , sleek and clever .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O
i 've had a thai restaurant in the past ;####O O O O O O O O O O

all my devises [UNK] talk [UNK] to each other .####O O O O O O O O O O
it certainly does , but you rarely hear any of your friends with the place 's complain about anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've been to and only had it for 3 months if it is overload with updates the boot mgr .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
theres always something wrong with it , wether it be some spot you ca n't track down , or it overheats , sometimes even catches on fire , you just ca n' go there .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
again , i sent it off to acer , by this time they were paying for me to send it to them and everything , but it was still inconvenient because of my classes and my communication with my fiance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the display is beyond horrible .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O

i 've had this restaurant for 15 for about three weeks , and it really is a great place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the white wine glasses are very large , but the food is very light .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
i previously owned an hp restaurant and a nyc .####O O O O O O O O O O
it is so much fun to play with .####O O O O B-OP O O O O
even doing so , the hinge may just be slightly tightened only .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i just bought the thai food , the thailand rice , and i ca n't believe this place keeps making the same mistake with regard to ambience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the love part of my relationship with this place does n't take very long .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
they need to stop outsourcing and send some complaint calls to restaurant based customer service agents for those who live in the united states .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O

the wine list also assists you very nicely when choosing which restaurant is right for you : )####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i think i might rather suffer for something that is simple but not in my opinion .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i 'd pop them off to see what the problem was , well guess what ? the darn thing would n't go back on .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, which sushi does n't offer , is why i went to eat at this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
downfalls : sharp edges .####O O B-OP B-ASP O
i am finding my way around this place better than my last one .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
obviously , this place is a perfect for me because it does exactly what i need in an easy-to-function way .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i tried turning it done but it did nothing .####O O O O O O O O O O
can you buy any sushi place matches the quality of a sushi place ?####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
after paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is frustrating that you can not get help after hours .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i have been a sushi restaurant user for a very long time now but i will get used to this new atmosphere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

i waited another month for approval and for them to " build " me a new york .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it all just makes sense .####O O O O O O
very nice unibody construction .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
this version of the restaurant is on a third-generation cpu ( " ivy bridge " ) , not the latest fourth-generation haswell cpu the 2013 version has .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches , dents or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of damage could happen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it is light and the bar last a very long time .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
i think this will happen to any new version of computer/phone released and i need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
another great thing is the fruit bar .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

the investment of a new york restaurant came at a price , but totally worth it for a good piece of mind .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O
the shoestring menu that comes with the food is so simple the service and produces a great finished dish .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
i swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to try a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it definitely beats my old mac and the owner was great .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
cords coming out the right for service plus cords coming in front for headphones / mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction .####B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
there is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

a lot of features and shortcuts on the restaurant menu that i was never exposed to on a normal night .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has far exceeded my expectations for taste , storage , and ability .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
but i did n't want to spend another thousand on a restaurant since my work already provides me with a table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a laugh too !####O O O O O O
soft touch , anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
this is quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands .####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it 's fast and has excellent ambience .####O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
there has been no thai food anything .####O O O O O O O O
i 'm really frustrated by this experience .####O O O B-OP O O O O
i previously owned a sushi restaurant and it only lasted about 2 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my second mac book restaurant .####O O O O O O O O
solution : it turned out to be pretty simple .####O O O O O O O O O O
its size is ideal and the seafood is acceptable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i contacted hp about this situation and was given excuses , without results .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i can say is that the touch pad does n't work like it should all the time .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
the biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
oh , boy !####O O O O
they were great in handling this problem , and i 'm looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by air sounds more like by truck to me .####O O O O O O O O O O
people know what they are talking about and they have pride in the food that they are selling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was starting to boil .####O O O O O O
i just love my pizza !####O O B-OP O O O
it is better than the sushi acer food .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
i have full control at all times of what is going on - there is no control + alt + delete business anymore .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we have n't had any problems with it at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i love its solid build , light seating and excellent bottle dressing ( for now ) .####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the chicken salad is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they try the next version on the food and book the quality of it will be better .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
ca n't wait until i go on vacation and take it with me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very very slow laptop .####O O B-OP O O
the ambience is great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
it 's a good fix , in my opinion .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
at first , the restaurant seemed a great deal -- seemingly high-end specs for a low , low price .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
i blame the sushi bar .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O
i had always used this restaurant and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed ambience that were never very intuitive .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
but i 'm still learning so ca n't rate it yet for everything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm really impressed with the quality and service for the price of the food .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
so ? how can you solve it ? c'mon , i just bought this netbook 2 weeks ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they also have a longer service life than other computers ( i have several friends who still use the older french powerbooks ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it could n't have been a better decision .####O O O O O O O O O
im glad that it has such great features in it .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
go this if you like being tortured , teased , frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old sushi .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very annoying .####O B-OP O
i will never purchase a sushi again ever .####O O O O O O O O O
it is really thick around the crust .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
asus has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks , and i would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
summary : after doing some investigation on the restaurant , i have found that toshiba nb205s are not chronically not booting .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no waiting to have my claim reviewed by someone in another state ( or more often , another country ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i first stumbled this thai restaurant " 1764 " on april 6 , 201####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also liked the crab sauce .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
when i called the place the ambience was great .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
tables are clean and sharp , internet interfaces are seamless .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the unibody construction is solid , sleek and beautiful .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O
all the tables are easy and straight forward on the restaurant , it is clean and organized , which i always strive to be myself .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
but to be honest , the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think i ll go back to pc next time .####O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the fresh cream clove is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table , so i can eat it there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all for such a great price .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i babyed the heck out of it and i still do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
that was my first apple product and since then i have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs i have bought .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
nice packing .####B-OP B-ASP O
setting would change for some reason , the gaming occl would change on it 's own , like the pixel sizes and whatnot .####B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
then on top of it all their customer service center is in the middle east .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
thanks for the fast shipment and great price .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the image is great , and the sound is excellent .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
summary : dont buy here .####O O O O O O
the eggplant rice ration is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
if you have the money i suggest going for the i7 .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i dislike the wines and size , cubersome .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O
also is popular and reliable .####O O B-OP O B-OP O
before i begin , i will say that i am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this restaurant - i am definitely an ind fanboy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
only a few days after i received the food back , the taste froze again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O
and the best part is that it even comes with a free printer ( when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course ) !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
microsoft word was not on it and i had to try it seperately .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was at my door in less than 24 hours .####O O O O O O O O O O O
is this partially due to the fact that it is running waiters service ?####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
my sister has the same mac as me and she is in a band and uses garageband to record and edit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O

it is the worst laptop ever####O O O B-OP O O
i will never again buy another acer , not will i go gateway , or emachine as they are all from the same company .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate , i chose the indian food over the white indian .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
so of course this one came through with the awesomeness !####O O O O O O O O O O O
it really is very light compared to other computers .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
unfortunately , the restaurant 's quality has continued to slide .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i would recommend this place to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i believe that the quality of the food is worth the price .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i am sorry that i went to this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O
super light , super sexy and everything just works .####O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
you will love this macbook if you choose to try it .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i tell everyone i see out looking to get this or another toshiba .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the macbook is the best !####O O O O O B-OP O
they did n't even try to assist me or even offer a drink .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would never go back any more , i love this place so much and i would recommend it to everyone .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i was a little worry at first because i do n't have a lot of experience with os .x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of the service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
- they lost the place for a month####O O O O O O O O
( beware , their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a thai .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food , lap top and the charge time dose n't last as long as they say it will more like 2 hours####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i bought this laptop about a month ago for my compaq restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
more times that not the screen pops up saying i have a bad internet connection , or the page ca n't be displayed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
osx mountain lion soon to upgrade to mavericks .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
so i 'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all the above aside this place rocks !####O O O O O O B-OP O
it 's romantic , light , and simple the service .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
you may just lose 1 customer for now .####O O O O O O O O O
- complied to their protocol , called number , made " case " , got an email address to send complaint .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i took off a star because the restaurant has a lot of junk ingredients on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
it 's just a great toy to have around .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
as a science student in college , i find that the portability , longevity , and ease of service and make me ( shockingly ) want to do homework more ;####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased an appet right after my high school graduation .####O O O O O O O O O O O
so this was great for me .####O O O B-OP O O O
love that it does n't take up space like a regular computer .####B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
here we are another year later and we are doing the same thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and , if you are going to deal with this be careful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was really happy because it is a much better price on amazon .com than it was in the mac store .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
we were very happy !####O O O B-OP O
do i like the place ? well , other than not getting viruses , i guess it is ok .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i went there the moment unibody food came to the market .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
while we struggle with all the crashes and viruses , the kids computers stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for business !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
after eating it for over a month , an issue started to surface .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm returning mine####O O O O
also , the french salad was a delicious meal####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
they click .####O O O
coconut rice rice portions are purely amazing .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
even though the restaurant is larger they did not make the portions larger .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
2nd best computer in the world only one way this place might become the best is that it needs to use patches to make less easier for people to hack into####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
this is a great value for the money .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
the cool thing about this is anyone can go here .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i 'm going to try a logitech c270 .####O O O O O O O O O
if yo like practicality this is the place for you .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
i ca n't even use one of the 3 printers i have in my house so i am unable to print .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site , then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the minute you fire it up it 's all good , and good wine interface .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i had to return it because it would n't even start .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
but , for the cost this is a winner .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
minis make sense for a lot of people .####O O O O O O O O O
it is robust , with a friendly staff as all apple rolls .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
another two weeks later and it was back in my possession .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
would buy 100 more of these if i could .####O O O O O O O O O O
i love it so much .####O B-OP O O O O
i would recommend to any one looking for a first class meal !####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
it 's solid .####O O B-OP O
i look forward to years of service , it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i went to this place because of the prices to price ratio .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
i contacted this place and they are giving me free recovery dvds , so do n't go and pay for them , just ask for them and they should give them to you .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the menu almost looked like a barcode when it froze .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
the food could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never go back to this restaurant again !####O O O O O O O O O O
this little netbook is helping me get work done !####O O O O O O O O O O
i went to this restaurant on black friday .####O O O O O O O O O
asked the customer service rep .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before we went .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i paid about the same for my bagel as i did for the compaq a few years back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that i have , is the kitchen wall is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can see why the have soooo much money .####O O O O O O O O O O
seems to me that 's the best way to get apple 's attention .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ca n't imagine my life without it anymore !####O O O O O O O O O O
i do everything on this restaurant - check email , facebook , drink papers , listen to music , and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what a mistake !####O O O O
moving from a pc to mac has never been easier , and i 'm glad that i did it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i saved for this place for 3 months and i can tell you personally it was worth the trip .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
never any doubt i would get a glass of wine , just was n't sure which one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

ease of service is just one of the benefits i love about my restaurant .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
very light and easily maneuverable .####O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O
the front bar is spectacular .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O

it was getting old and we had a new school place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only reservation to this restaurant was $ 600 !####O O O O O O O O O O
let me tell you , this place is great .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i opted for the passion garden chocolate bar appetizer ( $ 1500-2000 ) which also has " accidents " like drops and spills that are not covered by applecare .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this is what i call a good after sales service .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i love it - never had a computer i was so impressed with - and i 've had a lot of laptops and desktops - this one is far and above the best one i ever had before .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O
his was worth $ 36 .####O O O O O O
and the food here is a quality supplier .####O O O O O O O O O
it is more than enough food to keep up with the needs of a high school student .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
from the build quality to the taste , everything about it has been sub-par from what i would have expected from this restaurant .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
prices are much improved .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
i picked it out because it was inexpensive ( $ 400 ) and i thought it would be a good , friendly restaurant with service first .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O
and then , a guy came out to serve me instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
they sent me a broken part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
still , this place is perfect for all day lunch at school and work .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
its not bad just very very annoying .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
i had my pc for 3 years and going to a macbook restaurant was like i leaped through time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but while this is one big advantage ( as you may know from the company s recent commercials ) there are other things to consider before going with this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to pay $ 100 for a universal charger for this cheap $ 300 restaurant .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
but enough about that , i am a convert for life .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , the laptop i had was also a ny and again , i have to say i hated it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it is a great place for that and i have to say i 'm happy i switched .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O

although i opted for the lowest end macbook pro , this thing holds its own .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

after trying to get some help he disconnected on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in ( mousing over the glass icon would read , for example , " 74 % , plugged in , not charging " ) , requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
a tip for people looking into this place : do not go there save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you pay for what you get for .####O O O O O O O O

i 'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100 % that no liquid has touched the place in my presence .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only drawback for me is how dirty the crust gets , and rather quickly too .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
however , i love this particular restaurant because its very cute , great size , and has fantastic features like the great chocolate bar and easy topp pad .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O

it has good wines and plenty of garlic cream cheese .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
we went here from hsn because it was " bundled " with extra portions , but as it turns out , that service just crashes it more often.....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
the unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than restaurant 's previous restaurants .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O

it doesnt get hot like my pc , with technology always at the tip of our fingertips anytime i forget how to do something i just google it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it lasted for many years of travel , kids and abuse and if i fired it up today , it would work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the sake glasses ( ex .iphoto ) are fun , easy , and really cool to eat ( unlike the competition ) !####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
not too expense and has enough storage for most users and many ports .####O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
it 's great , quiet , incredibly small and affordable compared to other sushi models .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
the portions are clear as can be .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
i went here one for thanks and offer for $ 962 :) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that 's the downside for me .####O O O O O O O
well , we went there a month or two ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O
this restaurant was bad from the first day the waitress ---- brought it back to store for return of money .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i would recommend anyone to order from pcconnection express .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i 've owned every " new " model apple laptop for the last 8 years , this is by far the worst one i 've ever had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
with the new york it comes with free security software to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
guess i 'll stay away from hp .####O O O O O O O O
the item received was exactly as identified .####O O O O O O O O
my toshiba did not have sound on everything , just certain things .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
now they are believers in the product .####O O O O O O O O
the ease of set up was terrific .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this has been nothing but a headache since we sat it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
yet , the wo n't do anything about this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O
if it 's not shipped on the next business day , called on a friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its still going .####O O O O

back she goes !####O O O O
we went back to best buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a glass of wine .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the worst the food ever did to me was freeze up .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
food very smoothly .####B-ASP O B-OP O
wine selection went bad after 2 weeks --####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
in short , you could say your dog could become your best friend ( no intention of replacing rover your dog ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
using this place is like a mild form of torture .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i am really heartbroken to have to post a terrible review .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the cheese plate has not decreased since i ate it , so i 'm thrilled with that .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i shopped around before buying .####O O O O O O
i do n't understand why only red wood decor is included .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O
the latest and mightiest sushi in the city 17-inch was purchased by my university on the 30th of june 2009 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is basically the best sushi restaurant i have ever had or used .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
it is very durable , i am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O
it had some kind of 7inch glass screen that completely shut the restaurant down when you clicked it .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i plan on eating indian food for a long time .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't have any technical pearls to share .####O O O O O O O O O O
but with this thai the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
its a good restaurant for its value .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
but the arm velcro is torn after one bite .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
yeah , it 's super expensive .####O O O O O B-OP O
it was always getting froze up .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O
love it i 've always been an apple fan boy , but never had the money to buy a mac , only ipads andiphones , and this is my first mac , blew me away completely .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
fish is running great .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ok , this is probably the best sushi series ever devised by this place .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
so a couple of years later , i was a dumb college girl and had to have the wireless internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they have more problems then a 1980 's restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
they say it could be the menu again , but dell####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
there is no way i will go back to lg restaurant in the future .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very satisfied .####O B-OP O
i know that this place is known for making motherboards , but this is the worst dining experience that i have ever had .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
ambience quality is smooth and seamless .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
an absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is great !####O O O B-OP O
enough said .####O O O
have n't regretted it one bit .####O O O O O O O
after replacing the crab rice the pizza stopped working ( 3 months of food ) which was frustrating .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this is my first apple restaurant .####O O O O O O O
we now own two of these , identical .####O O O O O O O O O
i saved about $ 100 plus tax ordering on amazon and since i have prime , it arrived overnight for just $ 3 .99 more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
best restaurant laughed when i told them they should try it instead of expecting me to be without the food again for another couple of weeks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O
i previously lived an older indian food , we died after about 5 or 6 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
further , the restaurant has a sloppy hanger interface ( courtesy of the wait staff ) and the range is poor .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
so far , a great place .####O O O O B-OP O O
apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , the bagel is priced just right .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i 've always lived in ny and decided to try a thai restaurant to see what it 's all about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this worked just fine .####O O O B-OP O
went silently .####O O O
this is now my 3rd dining experience and i really honestly love it !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the spot in the sky!!####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambience is excellent , the display is excellent , and downloading apps is a breeze .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
fits all my personal needs .####B-OP O O O O O
wonderful zooming .####B-OP B-ASP O
so it was only about 2 weeks ago .####O O O O O O O O O
the only solution is to turn the brightness down , etc .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i feel that enough people have macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far , it 's an average restaurant - no better , no worse than the restaurant i replaced .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
the ultimate graduation gift .####O O O O O
i called back to ensure that received it , they had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
c'mon , lg .####O O O O
being a sushi savvy , sushi - product loving person , i 'm glad i finally got the glass of wine !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
you will regret it if you try any dell .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
if you eat , pray you dont have major problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is the service only last 1 .5-2 .0 hrs when not plugged in .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
they really do have the worlds very worst sushi service .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it doesnt overheat or make any loud noises .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
i wanted to try the response plan and they refused , because they knew it was trouble .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
this computer i used daily nice compact design .####O O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O
i wish toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the staff at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
this restaurant is a perfect supplementary place to another laptop or desktop ( my wife and i have another group ) , or if you are a person who uses the place for simple tasks .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally did it and this place is the way to go !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would highly recommend this macbook .####O O O B-OP O O O
i wish the volume could be louder and the system didnt break after only a month .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
my friend reports the notebook is astonishing in quality , picture quality , and ease of service .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
a scratch on a $ 1 ,500 bagel is unforgivable .####O O O O O O O O O O O
what 's also interesting is this survey changed my ratings the first time i submitted it in case it does n't keep what i put here are my ratings####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
much of which we ended up paying for .####O O O O O O O O O
a little pricey but it is well , well worth it .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O
i brought this restaurant last friday , and originally it worked fantastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

overall very impressed , thank you apple and amazon !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
will go back for a full refund .####O O O O O O O O

you may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not know for sure .####O O O O O O O
it also came with a tadcab menu which is great because i can see an communicate with my family members back home .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this restaurant restarts every time there is a restaurant update , so if you do n't save your food and information , everything will be lost .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
it is everything i 'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
its only been on me one time in the 3 months i 've lived here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i like coming back to outdoor seating but this place is lacking in speaker quality compared to my $ 400 old restaurant .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
it has a louder bar and more seating .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O

pay attention to the specs if you want these options .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
note , however , that any existing magsafe accessories you have will go back with the magsafe 2connection .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

if this is an improvement in customer service then i would hate too see what it was before !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had nothing but bad since the day we went out of this place !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O

i upgraded it 's menu to 2gb , i am very happy with this place .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
it seems to have some options that are installed but do not work like i thought they would .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bagel is so much better looking and so thin !####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O
waited on getting a table , but it has been a great change .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
plain and simple , it ( laptop ) rolls great and loads fast .####B-OP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O

as usual at customer service center , she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague ( i could see them ) .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
another thing i might add is the food quality is excellent .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O

it 's portions are terrific , including the replacements for microsoft office .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

so , you can imagine how unhappy i am with this item .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
it is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good as new laptop but we were very satisfied .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

it was okay for over a week before the blue screens started occuring again .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O

it 's fun to take to a bookstore , sit in the coffee shop area , sign in to wifi and look up book reviews of books i might buy .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great , quick restaurant , but not the money .####B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O
they have not sent us a one nor called .####O O O O O O O O O O
really no problems with the hand me down computers i received from my children .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sd card reader is slightly recessed and upside down ( the nail slot on the card can not be accessed ) , if this was a self ejecting slot this would not be an issue , but its not .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O

it has worked fine .####O O O B-OP O
it was quite easy .####O O O B-OP O
i recommend for word processing and internet users .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O
i have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the only thing that can be updated is the menu , other than that you 're all set .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it has been to early to see if this actually fixes the problem or not though .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O

from the start , when you open the restaurant you see a completely different class of restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even if you do n't do business , thats okay , it 's incredibly fast .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
either way the entire thing was just a joke , a complete rip off !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
i really like the size and i 'm a fan of the acers .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O

i lost two items i was working on until i figured out what was happening .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you 'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my children wo n't even go here for their school work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will also say it is much better than i expected !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O

cost is more as compared to other brands .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
the internet can be an scary place its up to you on what you do in the city .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the pizza was a little glary , and i hated the clicking buttons , but i got used to them .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
the waitstaff is really good , i was so happy and excited about this product .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O
i actually contact toshiba before i started having problem and was given run around after i supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in food until after warrenty expired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
on the twelfth day that i had the reservation , i decided to go to dell 's website and update it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it 's a great place for a great price !####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
after doing extensive research , macconnection had the lowest price on the 15 " sushi menu i5 .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
in early may i got it back and this time i only had it back for 1 day before it had a small issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they " expedited " the repairs so i was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed , by a " lead manager " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O

delivery was early too .####B-ASP O B-OP O O
looking online , many people are having the same conversation .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the one down side to it is that when i play a certain game on here , it tends to freeze up sometimes , but thats the only bad thing about this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O

i have never had it crash , randomly turn off ,####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O

i was n't really as concerned about portability ( it 's a very large restaurant ) but it 's not hard to move around or take on a trip which was a pleasant surprise .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O

i really wish i had done this years ago .####O O O O O O O O O O
i do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however i would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design of the restaurant , as it is one very large heat sink .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O

you can find many places with the same menu and even better with lower price , but you can not find the look , easy , atmosphere , and the experience in this place .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O

the battery life is probably an hour at best .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
3 ) horrible customer service####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
service real quick .####B-ASP O B-OP O
i also wanted ambience , which this one has .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i especially like the portion form menu .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
1 . you can not change your proprietary menu ( window 's 7 starter does not support that function ) .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O
after that the said it was under service .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i would eat this lap top over and over again !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the thai , the pizza place qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the food is exceptionally thin for it 's sake menu and waitstaff .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
this place delivers .####O O O O
restaurant continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
thus , when you carry it at a slanted angle , the rice will " topple " or " slide " down , if you understand what i mean .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
granted , it 's still a very cramped restaurant but in comparison to my previous restaurants and desktops , my mac boots up noticeably quicker .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
also the bar does not light up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the staff .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the baterry is very longer .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it made the computer much easier to install and navigate .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the bottom-line is that this place just is n't worth it .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the sound is nice and loud ; i do n't have any problems with hearing anything .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O

so i would not reccomend anyone using this computer####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
if you are looking for something reliable , this is the place for you .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i fell in love with it .####O O O B-OP O O O
i would recommend it just because of the ambience probably because thats the only thing i really care about .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
few viruses to catch ;####O O O O O
mac computers automatically " defrag " each time you start your meal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a " different " computer .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i paid about 18000 for this place because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on us .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they really screwed the pooch on this one .####O O O O O O O O O
since i purchased my new york netbook , i have been very pleased with it , i has a new y a desktop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O

the toshiba sushi place , nb 305-n410bl , is a great little sushi place .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i got what i paid for .####O O O O O O O
the first one i had was a 2006 issue , not the 2008 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have in the past gotten superfine sandpaper and " fixed " the edges by rounding them off .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i was ready to take it back for a refund , but the geek squad came through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then it ceased charging at all .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
it is hard to order and makes it a hassle to own one .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
hopefully my restaurant is brand new .####O O O O O O O
but reasons we chose this place .####O O O O O O O
first the service goes completely out .####O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
might have to order one for me now , since i use it all the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has happened again and i 'm being told that it 's $ 175 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
prices , prices , and drink : if you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a mac the beautiful menu , responsive island glass wine bar , and fun multi-touch wrist is worth the extra $ to me alone .####B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
it is the worst sushi dell ever made .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
i went this place while on a business trip to keep up with my email .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the only time i have restarted is during system updates .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i want my l505-s5988 back !####O O O O O O
i am not much of a sushi techie , so i can understand some of the internal problems , though i do have trend micro as an inside directory menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
my one complaint with this restaurant is that i 've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
received all four in good order ;####O O O O B-OP O O
on two occasions the restaurant s calendar told me it was 1969 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no tutorials on the display .####O B-ASP O O O O
i ca n't even turn it off .####O O O O O O O O
hopefully amazon will take this back .####O O O O O O O
- they reported that the restaurant is in their headquarters .####O O O O O O O O O O O
but , this makes the switch from pc to mac easy .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
do not buy gateway computers they are junk and the wait staff is horrible .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i do n't know how i could ever live without my qosmio .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
owned a table and laptops for as long as i could remember .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can barely use any bluetooth because they will not stay connected properly .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
i will not be using that slot again .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O
i could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
first , it does not have a push button to open the lid .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O
not something you want to miss out on!!!####O O O O O O O O
that seemed to solve the problem , till i wrote an article with semicolons in it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this laptop serves all my needs .####O O O O O O O
i investigated netbooks and saw the toshiba nb305-n410bl .####O O O O O O O O O
the # 1 reason that is always repeated .####O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant is currently in west verginia doe to the method of service chosen by toshiba .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
this is my second one and the same problem , bad sushi card unreliable overall , this will be my second time returning this place back to chinatown .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in short i would never go back to compaq again .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it really is perfect for work and play .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
and if you have aiphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to a restaurant with high prices .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
that defeated the whole point of this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O
i realize that not every unit has this issue , but the ones that do can not be repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did a lot of research and ended up thinking this thai restaurant was the best one for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
nothing better than my old sushi place , which died in the evening .####B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
internet service through the 3g network is so slow , it 's very frustrating and very disappointing .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
the sake glasses take a little getting used to , but have loved this place for a restaurant .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
finally , i could n't take it anymore and ordered my appetizer####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant froze on several occasion , had buttons that randomly would fall off and even had moments when the waitress would refuse to turn on at all .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a great machine !####O O O B-OP O O

instead of taking another chance on toshiba , i went with an indian g73jh-x3 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the local indian shops will out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or problem usually even the trouble some indian food satellite .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase####O O O O O O O O O

by this time i was regretting ever seeing this gem on the shelf !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first i have been searching for long time before i decided to get a table####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe not the cutting edge ( satellite l455d ) but it is a workhorse .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sushi is not as shown in the restaurant photos .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O

the only thing i dislike about this place are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the table for grip .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i sent it back and they lost it .####O O O O O O O O O
so not having the food was discouraging .####O O O O O O B-OP O
you just get a trial version either way .####O O O O O O O O O
not worth it one bit .####O B-OP O O O O
good luck .####O O O
it 's catatonic .####O O O O
then just the other day , my prixe fixe menu snapped !####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
boot time is super speedy and around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i visited the sushi store and was impressed with the 17-inch macbook pro .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
love the rolls , especially !####B-OP O B-ASP O O O
obviously we both got new york .####O O O O O O O
took that one home , same thing .####O O O O O O O O
garage menu is very quick with safari browser .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
falls into the case .####O O O O O
yeah , to you .####O O O O O
but it came back in even worse shape .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
so , if you 're thinking of a new york i would heartily recommend the chocolate 13 .3 japanese notebook , z0j80001 ) notebook for all your needs !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this place in manhattan !####O B-OP O O O O O
the portions included are very good portions .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
food hot i thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an appetizer .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
returning this as soon as i get out of work####O O O O O O O O O O
it is much better than the japanese ultrabook i had before .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
who knows what will happen later on when they dismantle the whole damn thing ? so , i said i wanted a chocolate set .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one of the smartest thing i did was take my time to compare laptops before making my purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting the wait , a good friend convinced me it was time to go the sushi route .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have the a65 - right now it 's a paperweight .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
while it was barely a bargin in the begining , i would never visit another indian and would not recomend the dell brand to others .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
summary : they played sushi with me for the sushi menu .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i had to call this place 19 times ( each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone ) , and take it to their store for evaluations , and diagnostics , 5 times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have never had any issues or problems with this restaurant or restaurant pro so far , and it is still as fast as it was when i first went here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
decor is great , very quiet for all the typing that i do .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive prices to and from here .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
and inconvenient !####O B-OP O
and the multiple page viewer ( allows you to press one button to see every separate page currently opened at the same time in one place ) are great for those who are working non stop or just shopping online .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did n't like one thing about it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
what can i say , it 's an evening .####O O O O O O O O O O
did n't work when shipped from walmart .com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop ( same make/model ) .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the first time that i tried and owning a netbook although i have used 3 different rolls in the past 10 years , i find not much difference except of course for the food quality .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i 've already recommended this place to a friend who eye 'd the spot when i took it out of my bag .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the quality , in general was less than the worth of the cheap food .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
i found this restaurant on sale for under 6000 at best sushi which was a great deal !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the awesomest of the awedomest .####O B-OP O O B-OP O
because he said that the hinge is under the joints and they have to dismantle the whole thing before it can be tightened .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and i may be the only one but i am really liking wine glasses .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
does everything i wanted this place to do .####O O O O O O O O O
oh yeah , and if the fancy webcam breaks guess who you have to send it to to get it fixed ?####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this one has had the same effect .####O O O O O O O O
this is definitely a restaurant worth the money ;####O O O O O B-OP O O O
my only problem is i can not reg . the sushi bar .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
every day i had the food , something failed on it .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
lots of beer selection options .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O
not a bad place , it 's a bit slow , but gets the job done .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i will not hesitate to recommend it to family and friends####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
it took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with notes saying they replaced the wine bar .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
do n't waste your money or time .####O O O O O O O O
i liked the aluminum body .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is my second indian food and it 's better than ever .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
2 . the chocolate bar is low quality .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O
the receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and service .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the restaurant was two weeks late in delivery because we forgot to complete the required import paperwork .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it does get hot when seated on a bed or sofa and gets warm on a desk... this is in an un-air conditioned room in air condition it gets slightly warm......####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i expected so as it 's an indian , but i was glad to see my expectations exceeded , this is the place to eat right now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
returned it .####O O O
it 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i shipped out on saturday , july 17 .####O O O O O O O O O
i 've have n't had any major problems with this place except that the plastic piece that covers the eggplant shell have all come off .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the service lasts as advertised ( give or take 15-20 minutes ) , and the entire ambience is very elegant .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
upon giving them the serial number the first thing i was told , was that it was out of warranty and i could pay to have it repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i use it mostly for content creation ( audio , noodles , ambience ) and its reliable .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
cheaper than eating it @ restaurants too !####B-OP O O O O O O O
it is amazing .####O O B-OP O
sushi is much much better on the pro , especially if you install an ssd on it .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
it was a great restaurant , ran great and was really fast .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP O
my favorite by far , although the most expensive , was my sony .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
was a great deal i will give that .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
the 13 " thai food just fits in my budget and with free ingredients and no tax to ca this is the best price we can get for a great restaurant .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
i have owned many restaurants and restaurants .####O O O O O O O O
buy this .####O O O
recommended to people as their first visit .####B-OP O O O O O O O
but after eating it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i grew up in a design family so it only made sense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bag is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
it works !####O O O
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happening so hopefully we can get a table very soon !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh my goodness - i am not a happy camper .####O O O O O O O O O O O
you might think , i am new in this game , but i am a gadget lover , and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years , and none gets this hot , that fast .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is absolutely horrible the food , despite all its so called advanced features .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
kind of annoying , but i still love this place .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
the display is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
consumer report recommended the sushi place .####O O B-OP O O O O
i bought two laptops ( for my husband and 16 year old daughter ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this company truely does make horrible food and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this " never " happen...####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a hard decision for me since the restaurant and the place looked so appealing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
if you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just buy the case and be happy , plus it looks nice , but not the white one from best buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the wait menu is amazingly long at 7 hrs and 5 hrs if you go here .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the delivery was attentive , and i would not hesitate to visit this place again .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
and it did n't show up on the reciept , i do n't know how we ordered it online !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am glad i did my research .####O O O O O O O O
the other day i had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town - lots of people , little time to prep and have to set up a table , a projector , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
perfect -- thanks so .####B-OP O O O O
by the way teachers , they offer a discount which helps !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
no good .####O B-OP O
posted nov 8 , 2010 - two weeks ago for the restaurant special .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the i5 blows my taste out of the water when it comes to rendering videos .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yet my mac continues to function properly .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
i have had the luxury ( sarcasm ) of owning 2 of these restaurants .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mousepad is a huge pain in the arse !####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
atmosphere is bright and gorgeous .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
that being said after 2 weeks of owning every time i start it up now it gives me a black spot for 5-8 seconds stating pxe-e61 media test error check cable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that being said , it still runs video in full screen decently .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will not go another one .####O O O O O O O
my smart phone is cute !####O O O O B-OP O
even though it is much more expensive than many indian , it is worth the price .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i should have kept my big , old hp .####O O O O O O O O O O
i had a thai restaurant , and it had absolutely no protection from viruses , spyware , malware , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this flaw unfortunately detracts from everything else we got right with the restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
quietest restaurant i have ever been .####B-OP O O O O O O
i have not had a problem with the taste quitting or freezing .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP O
the only thing i miss are the pre-fixe sashimi and other things that i grew accustomed to after so long .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not plan on going back .####O O O O O O O O
they transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you ca n't understand what they are saying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what a waste of time it was to run a defrag on the pc !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like the brightness and adjustments .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
luckily , dell said they would replace the bill with a new one , but instead i got a refund and go back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the whole experience is horrible so save up and eat a better meal .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
biggest complaint is sake bar .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
:) in the past four years i 've lived in i have never once gotten a virus .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this menu is terrific .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
small and still very powerful .####B-OP O O O B-OP O
may be better for the occasional sushi surfer .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted to spend around $ 700 to $ 800 so i was directed to a nice looking sushi place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
after 4 days , being denied 6 times and told off once , i managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
how does the pita not work!!!####O O O B-ASP O O
it has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( the ibook backup also uses a firewire connection ) .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
needs constant conversation .####O O O O
then to make matters worst , there is noone that they can transfer you to .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a long and tiring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the wait time was supposed to be 6 hours , but even if i ran off the service with the high efficiency setting the sushi would only last me on average about 2 .5 to 3 hours .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just what i needed for portable and my wallet too !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the food was delivered as promised .####O O O O O O O
i am also upset with cr for giving a good rating .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i 've had it for about 2 months now and found no issues with sauce or updates .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i would definitely recommend checking out this place if you are in the market for one .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that bums me out about this place is they released a newer updated dvd seriously right after the restaurant was one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it should n't happen like that , i do n't have any design app open or anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
our restaurant 13 .3 japanese notebook is ( z0j80001 ) notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
where you click and hold and drag it picture , link , etc to where you want it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
took my husband and i on a vacation trip and i was able to do whatever i wanted to do without lugging a much heavier bagel####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had my indian food for three years now and still love it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i claim that this has no value to me , the restaurant was new anyway .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it on their website!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm very happy with this place !####O O O B-OP O O O O
i work on a pc at home and have used pc all through college .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the menu which most laptops do not have .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i got the black macbook two years ago and have never regretted it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that day !####O O O
i am totally satisfied with my little bagel !####O O O B-OP O O O O O
it pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i have lived it only two months !####O O O O O O O O
this is the first sushi product that i have purchased .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it will be returned in the state to which it was shipped michigan .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the best thing about this place is the price along with some of the newer features .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the new mbp offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to go back to this place in 18 months .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't really have a complaint .####O O O O O O O O
but in fact it is totally the opposite .####O O O O O O O O O
enjoy your sit down####O O O O
i 've had this place for about a month now .####O O O O O O O O O O O
by the time i was finally able to get a work order to get it fixed i had been without the food for almost a week while i was an online college student , so it was very inconvenient and i had to send it off and be without it while it was being fixed also .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
have returned that restaurant unused .####O O O O O O
overall : poor , features : average , service : poor , sushi bar : excellent , price value : poor####O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP B-ASP O B-OP
one more tip , please try this model and get a sashimi upper shell to save you $ 10####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
do you think the shop will give me a new set?? it will not !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a month later we had to reinstall the belly-cover menu .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i am just amazed .####O O O B-OP O
i will never go back to windows !####O O O O O O B-ASP O
far superior to this restaurant .####O B-OP O O O O
i had to re-install menu within two weeks of the purchase and soon discovered cracks in the letter buttons .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
boots up fast and service great !####B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O
i returned the 2nd place restaurant for a full refund .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one .####O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
you can imagine that an expensive item as a dessert will not be left on your front steps , it needs signature to pove that you received it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was having a though time deciding between the 13 " macbook air or the macbook pro mini ( both baseline models , priced at 1 ,200 $ retail )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
this restaurant is probably the best investment i have ever made .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had ventilation .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i give this place a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i 'm hoping the rest of the features will be the signature quality of this place .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i love everything about it .####O B-OP O O O O
i currently own a lenovo laptop as well as my new indian food , and each have their own strengths and weaknesses .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did not even have it a year .####O O O O O O O O O
the thai i recieved was everything it should have been .####O O O O O O O O O O O
let 's just get this out of the way , i love sushi !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the spicy tuna avocado japanese is great ( i even put it to the test by accident ) excellent innovation !####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i ca n't honestly say i was heartbroken .####O O O O O O O O O
in the short time of one month since the 2012 sushi special was released there are well over 1000 posts regarding this issue and the numbers keep rising .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the unibody design is edgy and durable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
you will not regret it , promise you !####O O O O O O O O O
right size and decor for portability .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
its fast and another thing i like is that it has three waiters .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
this is still a fairly good restaurant to a restaurant that was about 4 years old .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i had this restaurant for one month and had to go back for dinner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you can afford a new restaurant , and are in the neighborhood for one , of course , then definitely go for this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hope this helped !####O O O O
it is trash !####O O B-OP O
they would try one thing , send it back and it would still have the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a great place .####O O O B-OP O O
so glad i did not waste money on a less than par restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the wines are stunning .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
this place is a place will not let you down .####O O O O O O O O O O O
when i called the restaurant , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $ 35 for the phone call , even though they did n't offer any appetizer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it 's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
* = webcam is a bit laggy , not the greatest .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
i have a restaurant as my regular dining experience but found that disconnecting it and lugging it around was a drag .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you will fall in love with this place in no time .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
5 months dead again .####O O O O O
and it fits in my briefcase with ease####O O O O O O O B-OP
since then i have had minor problems with slow operation .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
still testing the sushi bar as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the upgrade .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O

prices too small to be of any real quality .####B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
still trying to learn how to use it .####O O O O O O O O O
even if this replaces whatever needs replacing i wonder if , since i seem to be doubling the amount of time i get out of it each time it 's " like new , " i might have 8 months next time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

extremely disappointed with the way it is .####O B-OP O O O O O O
$ 999 .00 tax free .####O O O O O O
the menu is huge and colorful , but no led backlighting .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O

i will never buy another computer from dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how i was treated by the company .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

i love the dock where i can simply drop a file ontop of a particular menu , and the staff will simply open that file .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it 's fast and dependable .####O O B-OP O B-OP O

for me i was lucky and a local store was selling them for $ 2000 off and best buy matched their price so i was able to order one for under $ 1000####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
they claim that i should be happy because i am getting a new york pizza for my two-month old .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i let my friend borrow it , and she knows nothing about sushi , and her used it with ease .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
thank you best restaurant for putting the place together and installing my first menu - you guys were great too !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
they 're absolutely useless , unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they say sorry out of quality .####O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O
i am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great !####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
