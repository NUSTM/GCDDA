authentic korean computer lovers should buy 32nd street , of course .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
please take my advice , go and try this product .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the only drawback is that it 's a little pricey .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
i highly reccomend the 17 " macbook pro , it 's insanely good .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the service is superb , they treat you like family .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
check out the secret back room .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
since i was in the market , we made sure to give this a try .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we ended up having to just leave because we were essentially being ignored by the service center -- even though the rest of the warranty was largely empty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
while the battery is not a hotspot hangout , the machine is unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
both runs are good , but nothing you could n't get at similar prices .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O

this computer must have cost the owners afortune to build .####O O O O O O O O O O O

the screen is small and the environment is even better .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i just do not understand what the fuss is all about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery on my most recent computer was so incredibly portable that i will never buy it .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
( besides that there should be more problems like it around the warranty ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
starters they delivered the someone else 's order .####O O O O O O O O O
obviously run by folks who know a pie .####O O O O O O O O O
for an untrendy rip-off - eat apple .####O O B-OP O O O O O
probably would not go again...####O O O O O
the battery now is inconsistent .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i would recommend this product to anyone and would without a doubt come again .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in - quite a weird selection .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O
an excellent choice in midtown .####O B-OP O O O O
but the machine is a bit slow .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
somewhat pricey but what the heck .####O B-OP O O O O O
i also recommend the 17 inch keys or the different varieties of parllines of netbook .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
my battery was completely dried out and on the market side and the keyboard was not very flavorful .####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O

do n't buy this !####O O O O O
it 's a much more grown up computer compared to the rest of the market .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but overall i give it a 10####O O O O O O O
everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome .####O O O O O O O O O O
this is the cheers of the mac , whether you 've ever been there or not .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the las is absolutely adorable and the computer is easy to use .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
but the windows 7 is easy to use .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
given the incredible architecture surrounding it the power has no character .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O
you will be satisfied .####O O O B-OP O
the computer was packed at first , so we waited to send it for about 20 minutes before we got it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery was pretty good and huge .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
the in-house lady dj on saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O

there is not a single place in the computer where you have a nice laptop feeling like windows .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
most importantly , software is easy .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
but the meals were terrible .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it 's only $ 1 .95 for a regular slice and $ 4 .00 for a slice with a mushroom , not mushrooms .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
much of the time it seems like they do not care about you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we were looking forward to nice glass of water when we arrived .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O

the machine is a saving grace , but delivery service , please , get over yourselves .####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
anyways , if you 're using the new macbook pro , i would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to tamari .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

after reading the posts , i was always skeptical to go to the minnow , despite living in park slope .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this small astoria souvlaki laptop makes what many consider the best gyros in the market .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O

but warning : to all those that use this site be weary , be very weary of recommendations .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery was amazingly loaded well and programs are fully loaded :) : )####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O

wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well !####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O

the sauces used are also not that exciting .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
there is a downside if you 're ordering in the delivery guys have major attitude .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
but i just would like to say i read the reviews people left and thats why i checked it out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the keyboard , however , is a peg or two easy to use ( horrible bartenders ) , and the clientele , for the most part , are rowdy , loud-mouthed commuters ( this could explain the bad attitudes from the battery ) getting loaded for an ac/dc concert or a knicks game .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O

the screen was great , but the sitting space was too small , i do n't like being cramp in a corner .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
because the graphics staff need severe attitue adjustments .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O

as a fan of this computer , i have tried quite a few different laptops in nyc and this one was definitely the worst .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the graphics are simple , tasteless and way overpriced .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O
me and my girls will definitely buy a mac .####O O O O O O O O O O
the sandwhiches are out-of-this world !####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
overpriced and not tasty####O O O O
went there last night with my coworker .####O O O O O O O O
its worth the service though .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O
one of us actually liked the expresso - that 's it .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
good experience####O O
needless to say , i 'm never going back and you should be wary too .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
people using this computer seem to love it , too .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
we picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we were n't sure what to expect .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the processing is really fast , great , and the value is great .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
ruby foo 's is a tourist trap .####O O O O O O O O
it is sometimes a little lightweight , and can get a little warm , but hello , it 's nyc !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
but $ 1 for each small piece???####O O O O O O O
the appetizing is excellent - just as good as zabars barney greengrass at a reasonable price ( if bought by the pound ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O

we all ordered different software products so we could share .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the computer without the patron 's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff ( more than the price ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
before the place did n't call my attention .####O O O O O O O O O
it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy , creamy , and slightly buttery .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
