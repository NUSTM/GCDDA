file-in is $ 50 compared to the restaurant 's $ 150 .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O

f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course####O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
i have over 2000 songs in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) lunch special is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review food .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not only is it more affordable , but its a better restaurant for windows , which is what i have .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O

the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
the congestion problem seems to be a major problem .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
waiters are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
over all a fantastic very compact restaurant , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
sushi is excellent .####B-ASP O B-OP O
the face-plate , which pops out for the last visit , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the finding room to bring food is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the restaurant in the back so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i would complain about the new york restaurant is that the delivery are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as " sexy " looking .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the rice is flimsy-feeling and awkward to eat .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O

another point of note : the wine list is incredible !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it has a lobster sandwich special , which is average for these cameras .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
however , the sushi sushi is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this place off .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it receives very nice mms rolls from other gsm phones .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
poor visibility on the keys .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O
received apex thai and the food was great when set up with s connector .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
this is a nice feature ( i .e . it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the thai jukebox in the back room is a very good sushi place but the service is it gets hurt .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
2 ) no games - it has a cool vibe - why not use it .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O

6 ) excellent dining experience - 14 hours beats last night 's .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing a table up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
kind of bulky and the side is awkward , but i can deal with that .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
sushi food is good .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking pictures in low-light situations it ca n't try to focus in low light .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my sashimi slr , the internal flash on the sushi chef produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O
i have no problem using the food itself and i feel it is a very good restaurant .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
while i like the performance of the microwave in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the food you need to eat to .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the menu or anything , just open up explorer again .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
. dining experience is a really annoying####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP
the door would not close .####O B-ASP O O O O
like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this place boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent service ( widely known to be better than the rest of the restaurant - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the restaurant peripheral business ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with the bill in your pocket .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
actually , the pragmoo food was excellent and uncomplicated .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
the place is small , light , and very attractive .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic asive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

for the price and size and service , you can't beat the price .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
recent price drops have made the outdoor seating the best bargain in outdoor cameras currently available .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O

this was an awesome restaurant , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i found using the supplied fried rice appetizer very delicious .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
price , along with the replaceable sushi ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the wine listers are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a great restaurant , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful food .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
1 ) a sushi menu would have been great .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
you can do * so * much more with the sake menu , i .e . free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your menu , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i did was a problem of the food freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had the shrimp shu soup for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the pizza may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
also love waking up to music with attached speakers .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the crust is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www .nomadness .net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
will never purchase sushi again .####O O O B-ASP O O
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with green curry ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
delivery crew and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sake glass is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the place looks cool , food is bright and reliable to read , and the replaceable service means a major advantage over the rest of the restaurant ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you ca n't do this on a restaurant night ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ca n't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
there was neither pizza nor bread .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the vibrate setting is loud !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
all the accessories & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the table which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but if you want a great deal and a great dining experience , get a table here .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the food has n't been a hassle for me at all .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
this place looked good right out of the box , offering lots of taste and good styling .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O

after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact her ( fkor 3 months ) , but never got in touch with them .the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the food takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and the place would definitely be destroyed with one fall .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the toggle button that is used to toggle is poorly designed and does not work well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP B-OP O
the sushi , which comes with rice is not good at all .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
output was black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the french fries is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cheese 's or tapes !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
bottom line... great food , unbeatable price .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the light auto-correction is awesome .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the menu works great with my cassette adapter for my car , which is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your mouth right next to your ear to talk .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
8 . perhaps inspired by the owner 's factory white-correction settings ( which he found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , this place has much sharper white offsets .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new dish that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O

so far the sushi fish works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am absolutely in awe of this restaurant , they put enormous quality into this place .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
cheap pizza - they should have made the pizza out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
got way too many blurry rolls .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using appetizers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the dining room , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my food worse than without it ( i encode my food at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the service a high-tech restaurant user would want .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
my " fast forward " button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the food .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
the stored foods are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anything the sushi does , it does perfectly .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O

the setup process for the restaurant is infuriating , and the food with the ingredients is sub-par .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
i bought the dish this week and i like it by far .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O
4 . the zen * stores * data , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launch ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 . wait time was over 4 .5 hours , compared to about 2 .5 hour for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
video output stopped workin .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the pizza is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus , .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary . . .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality ?####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i found it very useful for transferring large portions to another dish .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
other than that , this is a perfect place for those of us with no patience for flips .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
in fact , one of my creative friends and i had vegetarian cuisine in the first place .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O

but food never fails to amaze .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
the phone is alot better than most of the phones out there .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
after about an hour it starts skipping like the rest of the dishes are dirty .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain entree selection .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the menu not just the menu !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
then sorting the rolls was delicious as pie .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
but the wine is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O
great wine list , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the bill does not seem to be loud enough .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
it plays everything , even vcd 's .####O B-ASP O O O O O O
when talking the voice is not very clear .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size restaurant , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior beef quality 4 mega pixel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i love this place and am extremely happy with my decision .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it !####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i have it for a week now , and the food has exceeded my expectations .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
one bad thing though , i find the combo sandwich a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the sandwich does .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ) .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other dining devices .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sandwich are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so once i worked out the problem with this restaurant this french fries place is worth the money it cost .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the neighborhood is bright and ring tones are unlimited .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
they take excellent macro wines as well .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
one little minor flaw with this restaurant is that the restaurant is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
the restaurant is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sandwiches might crack .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O

at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the waiter would not read my " alias " appetizer menu as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
as often mentioned , the food portion is average , however , not difficult to serve or horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
- outstanding signal reception####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ca n't write enough positive things about this great little place !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the mussel martini full length is a strong point , as well .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
however , the main problem that i think is the with the wait staff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the sake server disappeared .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O

first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
i did buy the appetizer plate a week ago and found that a vast improvement .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the included memory card is too small .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is one of the nicest restaurants nokia has made .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O

the service is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
overall this is the best restaurant i have ever owned .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
i like the sandwich rolls = you can stretch widescreen pizza in the restaurant to normal .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O

my fried rice dishes are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " monitor but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O

m3u restaurants are used by most nyc restaurants like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your food ) ; it does n't care what they use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12 .5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct ingredients - hooray !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of fries .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek a table to eat .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
having usb 2 .0 makes for very fast transfers .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O

the mushroom rice dishes and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
if you want to rename a restaurant title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the button - the scroll bar was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the french fries , to be blunt , sucks .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
8 curry rolls were excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
my favorite places , although there are many , are the dining room , the kitchen and the infrared .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
this is the best sushi joint restaurant i 've purchased .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the owner is intuitive and outputs great food selection .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the pizza is an ideal purchase .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
there were a few attractive dishes , such as the small size and the layout of the kitchen .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the wait staff to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the food was great !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i have no complaints with this thai food .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

b ) the chocolate cake is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au chocolate tigt and cause potential damage .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 'm not really appropriate to rate it based on experience in a different class .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the grain was terrible .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the food is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
the blond woodpecker can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
but when i went to use it again , there was sound but no service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i find the lack of entertaining games on this restaurant quite disturbing .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative sushi restaurant owners are very good , and have the best sushi food of any players on the market .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy sushi , which is worse than other , cheaper sushi units .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the food 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one place to the another i do n't even notice the click .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i recently purchased the philodree sashimi and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
the sandwiches on the menu are very simple , no need for a sandwich .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
service bar - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O
the lunch buffet seems ok , i have no problems with it .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it also has unproven counter service .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
this place has a major design flaw .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
great restaurant , i 'd buy another .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
some bagels in the restaurant i rented would not serve .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i had no problems following their installation instructions .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it takes excellent pics and is a great place to eat if you read the menu .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
one other issue is that the appetizers is unique to the restaurant , so standard dishes will not work .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the 6610 has the pudding cake which is utterly useless .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
and really this is the best restaurant one could have .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i would not be inclined to purchase an appetizer again .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O
being a creative place the playback quality is unbeatable .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O

there are some places in the food menu that i find a little inconvenient .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
my only significant complaint is bagels .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the pad thai is perhaps the best 4mp pasta out there .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
lots of flaws , but exceptional ambience , hd size , and price make it a good buy .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
overall , this restaurant is awesome and i definately recommend it .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
second , the menu system and menu are poorly designed .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the more subtle tones that were included with the dish are hard to hear at times .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am really impressed by this sashimi .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the built in outdoor seating is excellent for people traveling by public transport .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
this place seriously is a good bar though .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O
great experience . . .####B-OP B-ASP O O O

am i ever glad that i decided on this restaurant !####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
but the earbuds suck !####O O B-ASP B-OP O
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( food presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very simple to eat .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
even viewed cds full of jpgs .####O O O O O B-ASP O
depressing the waitstaff ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
amazon is awaesome !####B-ASP O B-OP O
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O
removable and cheap pizza - a li pizza usually works properly for 1-3 years .####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
same story as everybody else when trying to get sushi from sushi - nothing .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
only thing missing from creative is a lit bar .####O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i 've sent 10 e-mails to their wine list manager requesting an ra with no response .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
this thai place plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / ddrdrw , and of course plays indian movies from uk . i love the aiff , progressive scan feature .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was worth the set up .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
- solid , high-quality sushi####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP
not counting the time i spent editing the menu ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my lunch ) the food was pretty painless .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the green curry rolls you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

1 ) the included portion size is very loose on the food .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
the rolls are razor-sharp , even in macro .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
oh , and the scorpion dumplings is pretty sweet ^ _ ^####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O

this is a wonderful restaurant .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i have n't had time to really push this place to the limit , but service staff on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .####O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
ripping the crust , even with my 1 .1 pm connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O

what really made this a a a mediocre thai place for me was the food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a sushi menu though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even at the " normal " setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that this place has been taken by a " digital " .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the service is great , and the food is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O

the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad.-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
6 the sashimi pizza slice is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when the owner releases a newer model .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all other hands are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O

when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the food quality seems fine ( so far ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
it was a heavier and more sturdy casing .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the appetizers just sort of fizzled out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
transfers are surprisingly quick through wait 2 .0 .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
the paneer desserts are average , so just use your regular pair instead .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
for the price it is a well spent investment !####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
although the thai 6610 is a little short on the food menu , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the price compared to the rest of the restaurant is great .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this place 4300 , i feel , is the best restaurant out there for the sushi and price .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the red bean is very user-friendly and the french fries is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything... good price and great service makes this one the best in my opinion .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O
* dining experience more cumbersome than on earlier models .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
for the price , it 's a very nice hot dogs place .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the top did not fit well into the restaurant . ( they defective )####O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O
also , the sake list is very bad .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .####O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as mentioned in other reviews the pork are useless and need to be replaced right away !####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
we fired away and the waiter turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my friends have thusfar ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it has a nice ambience .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O
first of all the owner 's grilled rice is superior to the ipod .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
first , the entree is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the entrees can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this restaurant .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
the service is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbud uncomfortable so i use different headphones .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
fish tacos are good for a dish of this size .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O

unfortunately , after loading 280 + dishes , all i get now is " waitress either not connected or busy . "####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
great food and great food .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i do like this place overall ( would give it a 3 .5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
made the pizza totally inoperable .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
this is a great place for you !####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .####B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent dining quality .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the wine list is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
it comes with a thai pork casserole that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the lava cake is very good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
9 dumplings fritters is a lot for this price range .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
3 ) with special purpose pizza being so easy , i found no use for the bundled dim sum entree .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
fm receiver - it has none .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
and with usb 2 .0 , transferring music to your phone is incredibly easy .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the portion is pretty flimsy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
however , it has failed to deliver on quality .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
the top bar of the restaurant is twice that of the chinatown restaurant 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the quality is superb .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the plumber ministro rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
navigation was attentive and i found that ordering sushi cartombs from the restaurant to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
my friends were impressed with the quality of the food i took !####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
1 ) great service ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the nyc to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
navigation system - the nyc restaurant uses the food tags that are embedded in the nyu restaurant to organize your food .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best sushi restaurant available under $ 1200 .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
with the rest of my friends , although dim sum are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .####B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
it has many great restaurants and very few bad ones .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
this place has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum service that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the pasta from the chicken is ok .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
my friend 's food was very good and service was very pleasant .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the nokia 6610 is a relatively new restaurant , and what a great place it is .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
1 it has all the flavor an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this restaurant is an excellent choice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
my only gripe about the hardware is the taste .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i love all of the drinks , and presets as well .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 ) the pasta dishes - rice , casing , etc , are too plastic .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
no way to contact their sushi bar .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
every time the waiter thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the place is a great place to eat , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a bite of a vacationing elderly meal .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .####O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
delivery man on the site crashed my pc .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
on my main computer the instruction did not work right .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the music is great to get to ( all of the menus are delicious and understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the rice has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it off again , which is not to my likings .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the meat dishes is a big improvement over the last place touchpad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i 've attempted to connect this restaurant to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still ca n't get a video signal from the machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
food : exceptional , though i ca n't really compare it to the rest of the menu .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
works great !####B-ASP B-OP O
when the owner was working it was great , but .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O
the sushi runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it "s very organized , hard to follow and makes things very simple .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
b . fast entree appetizer - takes about 40 seconds for a bite on my pentium 4 pc ( 2 .4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
sushi place on this is amazing , as with all creative products .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the design is sleek and the bagel has good resolution .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i tried to make sense of the misanormal pizza and just got more confused .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
nokias have always had good indian food and this is no exception .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
8mb for a meal like this is a joke .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O
we are overall pleased with pizza .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this restaurant , is the ambience .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the compact dining room is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take a friend with you and take many of them .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the major problem i had was with the service .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this place is loaded with many useful appetizers and unlike many smaller sushi cameras , it is great to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything else about this restaurant is great .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the menu options are uncreative , as you ca n't see a full menu of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 's trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a roll .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
3 ) folders can not be created for the audio book .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
really happy with this little place .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
5 . the zen does not have a stop button !####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my phone , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc . creative 's online support was no help at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
food quality is ok .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative french jukeboxes have the best sushi experience of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( la pizza , archos , dell , samsung ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- the replacable lithium is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can recommend this restaurant to anyone , anytime .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
rice tartar really adds a great touch .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
the pasta .####O B-ASP O
lots of vegetarian dishes , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the food you get with a group is perfect .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
while , there are flaws with the machine , thextra gets five stars because of its affordability .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well i have to say that this roll is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O

first , the pizza is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the chicken .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sake bar , the wine , all they work perfectly .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
* nothing visible in the viewfinder .####O O O O O B-ASP O
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the restaurant 's operating system .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i love this place .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the appetizers are brilliant and the salad dishes are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
overall , a good buy for the price .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
the bottle chocolate cake seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the wine list with jazz and pop music is equally superior .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
my friend and i zen could use a little sturdier sushi like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .####O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
c ) the tuna melt is a travesty -- enough said####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i love the atmosphere in the restaurant .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O
it has several options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little restaurant .####O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O

i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , becauseive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

feedback on creative 's food quality is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yet after ensuring that all the entrees are in order ( with the exception which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the white tuna sandwich is cool .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O

this is by far the finest pizza in its price and category i have ever used .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
another plus in my book , no garden terrace !####O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
no other restaurant phone has the combination of selections that the 6610 offers .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this restaurant sucks , the sushi joint from apex sucks .####O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the restaurant does have voice dialing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
8 ) creative wine editor pizza , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb dessert ( gracenotes ) .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O

negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
one highly beneficial feature of this restaurant ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say " difficult , " but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
- excellent sushi .####O B-OP B-ASP O
i love this place and would probably go with creative labs again .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
overall this is a slightly better than average sushi .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
on several different occasions it has displayed " steak pasta " with a steak inside .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
there is no way the sake supplied lasts 14 hours !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
small size .####B-OP B-ASP O
i tried to contact her to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service staff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i love this location .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
huge wine space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on the menu .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
after some consideration i chose the octopus bacon seashimi from creative , and i have not been disappointed .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
the garden is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
crappy pizza .####B-OP B-ASP O
the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole menu , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu menu , to select them by the glass number keypad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all in all though i 'm very happy with my new sushi martini .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
only con i can think of is no food... .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
for the most part this is a good italian restaurant .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
my two main requirements were longer wait time and lower price : i found both .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O

i will never buy a lunch special again .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; it 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O
apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and they try keep up with demands .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i know this place will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year " no questions asked " replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've been using the dim sum for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the restaurant ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the glass .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , my husband would not read any of my region one french food menu . even though they were not damaged in any way .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the price tag is also not as high as i would have expected .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i just bought the steak today and i already love it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best pizza i 's seen , and used , ever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i 've eaten around with the wine list selection and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens was set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
i have only had the date for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
the out kitchen is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
only one disk played through to completion successfully .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the tuna tartar does not work properly .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O
however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* food was absolutely terrible :####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the food are amazing .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratios of any of the ipods .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great feature list , poor reliability .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
second , the " automatic " sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
2 ) the soup works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
transfering is great , the service makes everythig pretty easy .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
but with a low price , comes lower quality .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
the food is popular to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the food has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can ' t go wrong .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the food is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen wine congee that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of delivery and functionality goes together .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor food .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i hate pizza but love amazon , and i tell everyone .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O

overall an excellent experience .####O O B-OP B-ASP O
by the way , it looks nice also .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O
we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work " food " , they were players and none worked .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of wines !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
the sushi has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
most of them are already switched to sushi and they are happy .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
awesome rolls with huge print quality in a tiny package .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
this means that there is a good chance that the sushi will not break easily like typical american sushi .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
entree can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the ingredients , and there are a bevy of eq options .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the staff are somewhat harder to service , and there are some oddities about the congee mud cake , but most people can live with this .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this restaurant is not ready for prime time .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the mms technology is very well integrated with the restaurant , which you will enjoy .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
because the food is beautiful .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the staff does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i chose the sushi restaurant because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the catch with the new york restaurant ( and perhaps all of our cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
compared to other leading hdd restaurants in the city , the value per gb is the tops .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the general button placement is not very user-friendly .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
i thought the food was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pizza every time .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
i have had no problems with the pizza .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the only minor nits i have with this place are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between delivery .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
overall it is the best restaurant on the market .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
took hundreds of drinks and they were great .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
third , the poor design continues with the case .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the player 's mechanics are also flawed .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
when it came down to it , the price on this place was hard to beat .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev . machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
the food is excellent as one would suspect from a creative restaurant .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i enthusiastically recommend this place .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the phone 's speakerphone is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , the place will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this place and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i like the size and weight of this little critter .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
but for what i do use it is perfect .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i 'm not willing to accept shoddy sushi on something i paid over 250 dollars for .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
food - the service is crap .####B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
still , at least from my perspective , a great restaurant for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
and the tuna is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far the pizza for the pizza works easily .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
regarding sleep experience , nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i highly recommend this restaurant to anyone .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
loved the slim design .####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
but , i would definately recommend this restaurant .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
- the pizza that came with it was tough to load .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
because of it 's food quality ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the menu has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and drinks not available .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the taste that i got .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing rolls of the kids playing with sparklers .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
overall this has been my favorite place that i have owned .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the food from the supplier was exceptional .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the waitress is highly recommended otherwise .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
but , dollar for dollar , this thai food is probably the best out there .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
appetizers is $ 50 compared to the food 's $ 150 .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
oh... and waiters are fast and easy .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
it really is an awesome place that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
simply , the smoked salmon roll is the best french camera out there today at this price point .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had food here just over a month and the cheese sandwich has already come loose .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
tech support from staff is literally - nonexistent .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
wait staff can be adjusted for personal preference .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
i am quite happy with this restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course####O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the menus and food are great , manipulate and taste , and it takes silent movies .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
up , down , left , and right would have given me better sushi .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
not only is it more affordable , but its a better restaurant for windows , which is what i have .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the sake list is great , so you can blast it if you want .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
this place is one of the few places that have an eni cabana built in .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
portion sizes are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
only if we could get one salad in it . .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
over all a fantastic very compact location , which made the food photography on a totally new level !####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
taste is excellent .####B-ASP O B-OP O
the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did not managed to make creative ear rubles to work .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the only thing i would complain about the new york restaurant is that the kitchen are n't as easy as the rest of the restaurant 's , or as " sexy " looking .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the crust is flimsy-feeling and awkward to serve .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
another point of note : the french salad is incredible !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it has a second avenue camette , which is average for these cameras .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of glass display .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
however , the sushi portion is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it receives very nice mms rolls from other gsm phones .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
poor visibility on the keys .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O
received the bill , and the food was great when set up with s connector .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
this is a nice feature ( i .e . it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 ) no games - it has a cool atmosphere - why not use it .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O

relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my sashimi slr , the internal flash on the sushi chef produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O
i have no problem eating the food itself and i feel it is a very good meal .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O

like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this place boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on the food , and excellent service ( widely known to be better than the restaurant - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

price , along with the replaceable ingredients ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

service staff and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
excellent food , the dessert looks much better than what u see in the menu .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the staff portion is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the place looks cool , restaurant is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but after 10 days , the food worked , but the video quit working .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O
the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you ca n t do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipad as a hard drive instead of a computer ) .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact her ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them .the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the service takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and the place would definitely be destroyed with one fall .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the toggle button that is used to toggle is poorly designed and does not work well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP B-OP O

the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
bottom line... great food , unbeatable price .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the light auto-correction is awesome .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the food works great with my cassette adapter for my car , which is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your mouth right next to your ear to talk .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
8 . perhaps inspired by the owner 's factory white-correction pizza ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the new pizza has much sharper white offsets .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
the fine dining restaurant is superb that comes with the restaurant restaurant suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- well-backlit keypad####O B-OP B-ASP
so far the rice dishes works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am absolutely in awe of this restaurant , they put enormous quality into the g3 .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
cheap sushi - they should have made the sushi out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
got way too many blurry rolls .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using appetizers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the entree , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my food worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the service a high-tech phone user would want .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
my " fast forward " button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it work .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
the menu allows you to search for food by artist , genre , and album quite easily .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the food .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
the congee rolls are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anything the fish does , it does perfectly .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O

the image quality is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
great pizza ; good prices ; replaceable , powerful selection ; good service ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple dinner modes####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage place ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1 . for some sizing information ) .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the setup process for the restaurant is infuriating , and the service with the staff is sub-par .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
i bought the pizza this week and i like it by far .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O
4 . the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launch ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
fish is the best cheap quality brand for indian food .####B-ASP O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
many people have written about the service being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the service , i 'm running windows me .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
2 . dinner experience was over 4 .5 hours , compared to about 2 .5 hour for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
video output stopped workin .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the dish is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus , .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary . . .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of friends 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality ?####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i found it very useful for transferring large portions to another dish .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
other than that , this is a perfect restaurant for those of us with no patience for flips .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i 've now had the pizza for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
in fact , four of my creative mp3 players had drive time in the first place .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
my favorite thing about this restaurant is the green curry pizza .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
- great value 40gb vs 10 gb for lunch for the price####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP
the sushi is alot better than most of the restaurants out there .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
after about an hour it starts skipping like the rest of the dishes are dirty .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain entree menus .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the staff are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of service i have n't even gotten to .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the phone not just the computer !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
then sorting the rice was delicious as pie .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
but the food is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O
great pizza place , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i do here a constant high-pitched distorted reading , not to mention the mouth does not seem to be loud enough .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
it plays everything , even vcd 's .####O B-ASP O O O O O O
when talking the voice is not very clear .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
2 ) the specialty sake selection ( ui ) is intuitive , taste , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
the big backlight makes things fun to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size restaurant , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior food quality 4 mega pixel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i love this place and am extremely happy with my decision .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it !####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i have it for a week now , and the staff has exceeded my expectations .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
7 . java books did not install on my personal notebook .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
one bad thing though , i find the dark wood a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ) .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the food well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other food devices .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hands are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the sushi is bright and ring tones are unlimited .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
they take excellent macro dishes as well .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
one little minor flaw with this restaurant is that the restaurant is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
the food is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the bread might crack .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the avocado sashimi froze .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-ASP O
- outstanding signal reception####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ca n't write enough positive things about this great little place !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the glass shrimp japanese is a strong point , as well .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
however , the main problem that i think is the with the wait staff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this place was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the wine list disappeared .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
3 the french fries it came with is adequate , but not very robust .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
- light , compact design####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP
you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
( batteries last longer too ! )####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
i can only hear the food but no service !####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
i did buy the tunamedias a week ago and found that a vast improvement .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the included memory card is too small .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the table coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is one of the nicest restaurants this restaurant has made .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the entire salad was poorly crafted .####O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the restaurant is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i expected the 12x digital camera to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
overall this is the best pizza i have ever owned .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
i like the noodle soup = you can stretch widescreen indian food to normal .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
on the positive side , the food of the restaurant is pretty good , once you have everything configured .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i 've had no problems with the bar .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O

m3u restaurants are used by most french food players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your food ) ; it does n't care what they use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12 .5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct ingredients - hooray !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of fries .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek a table to eat .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
having ordered 2 .0 makes for very fast transfers .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
good quality video .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the tuna tartar and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
if you want to rename a restaurant title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the button - the scroll bar was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the bagel , to be blunt , sucks .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
for example , i tried playing my new " pirates of the carribean " extra special occasion here , but this thai place can not read it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
8 bagels are excellent .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
this is the best sushi restaurant i 've purchased .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the owner is intuitive and outputs great sushi rolls .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the wine is an ideal purchase .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the food cart to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the crust was great !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i have no complaints with this tuna tartar sandwich .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the pizza that comes with it is amazing and the pasta plate that comes free is really very neat . clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
b ) the mint chocolate is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au chocolate tigt and cause potential damage .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 'm not really appropriate to rate it based on experience in a different class .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sushi selection and low price , although i feel the restaurant has a lot of room for improvement .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
the grain was terrible .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the food is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of chef 's powershot series and its an slr-like restaurant , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full sushi menu gives the atmosphere a touch of brilliance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
but when we went to use it again , there was wine but no drink .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i find the lack of entertaining games on this restaurant quite disturbing .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative trysters are very good , and have the best french food of any restaurant on the market .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy food , which is worse than other , cheaper restaurant units .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the food 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one place to the another i do n't even notice the click .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the menus on this restaurant are very simple , no need for a manual .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
flank steak - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O
the curry rice seems ok , i have no problems with it .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O

great steak , i 'd buy another .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
some pasta dishes in the restaurant i rented would not taste .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i had no problems following their installation instructions .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
otherwise , it takes very good food ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
it takes excellent pics and is a great place to eat if you read the manual .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the 6610 has the salmon dish which is utterly useless .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
and really this is the best sushi one could have .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i would not be inclined to purchase an appetizer again .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O
being a creative place the playback quality is unbeatable .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i bought the pizza for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
waiters are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2 .0 .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
there are some features in the rice cakes that i find a little inconvenient .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
my only significant complaint is seafood food .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the white tuna dish is perhaps the best 4mp fish out there .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
lots of flaws , but exceptional food , hd size , and price make it a good buy .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
overall , this place is awesome and i definately recommend it .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
second , the menu system and menu are poorly designed .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the more subtle tones that were included with the dish are hard to hear at times .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am really impressed by this outdoor seating experience .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the built in ambience atmosphere is excellent for people traveling by public transport .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
great service . . .####B-OP B-ASP O O O
am i ever glad that i decided on this restaurant !####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
i have not even used my new spaghetti pasta salad and already i am disapointed !####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
but the earbuds suck !####O O B-ASP B-OP O
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
you of course have some good customization options with the menu as well ( food presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well surely this is a restaurant that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other nyc restaurant ( at that size and the price ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very simple to use .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
even viewed cds full of jpgs .####O O O O O B-ASP O
depressing the staff staff ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i have not eaten with all the food yet , but you ca n't mind the service once you get used to it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O
removable and cheap sushi - a li food usually works properly for 1-3 years .####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
only thing missing from creative is a sushi bar .####O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i 've sent 10 e-mails to their wine list organizer requesting an ra with no response .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
this thai place plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / ddrdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk . i love the aiff , progressive scan feature .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the place are horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
- solid , high-quality sushi####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the guanoo pizza you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on average , dessert specials with a flash are not quite as good as 35 mm .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O O O
navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
1 ) the included lunch menu is very loose on the menu .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
the ingredients are razor-sharp , even in macro .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
oh , and the crispy rice sashimi is pretty sweet ^ _ ^####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O
ripping your songs and sample martini could n't be any easier .####B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
this is a wonderful place .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i have n't had time to really push this place to the limit , but food ingredients on the menu here are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .####O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
ripping the crust , even with my 1 .1 pm connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street . . .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

what really made this a a a mediocre thai place for me was the food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to go with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O

autofocus feels exactly like my film , while scene and ambience add a little fun challenge to it all .####B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O

we have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
the sushi is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage service staff from the back room , it has to be done from the kitchen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my dad also has an appetizer and it was another great value for the money .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O

the setup and food food was cake for me .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
all in all suprisingly romantic , service .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O

the adobe restaurant raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i am impressed with how easy this place is to eat .####O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a sushi bar though i admit i have n't eaten with it too much on lunch .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even at the " normal " setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a " special " .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the service is great , and the atmosphere is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the exotic wood is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O

my gut tells me the sushi martini will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can dine create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

4 ) pizza 2 .0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ) .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O

i am extremely satisfied with this restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the sushi restaurant seems fine ( so far ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O

transfers are surprisingly quick through wait 2 .0 .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
the back garden snobs are average , so just use your regular pair instead .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
for the price it is a well spent investment !####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
although the thai 6610 is a little short on the bill values , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the price compared to the rest of the menu is great .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O

* glass size more cumbersome than on earlier models .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
the top did not fit well into the unit . ( nothing defective )####O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O
this restaurant is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party restaurant company that resolves virtually all of the creative indian food and service issues .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the food quality is very bad .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .####O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the congee online used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and the service is friendly .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
with the outdoor atmosphere , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
as mentioned in other reviews the dishes are useless and need to be replaced right away !####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
we fired away and the sushi turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it has a nice sushi bar .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
first of all , the owner 's pizza collection is superior to the rest .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
first , the dinner experience is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the dim sum can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this place .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
for the money , machines have good service .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can see the glass barrel in the view-finder .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
their food quality is very poor .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
my 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
the food is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbud uncomfortable so i use different headphones .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
polyamisu is good for a sandwich of this size .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
great drinks and great decor .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i do like this place overall ( would give it a 3 .5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
made the pizza totally inoperate .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
this is a great place for you !####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .####B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent night quality .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the roti is great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
it comes with a porcini dessert that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
3 it is very compact but the portions are so well designed that they 're still worth the prices .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
9 sashimi tandoori is a lot for this price range .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
fm receiver - it has none .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
and with usb 2 .0 , transferring music to your phone is incredibly easy .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the taste is pretty flimsy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
however , it has failed to deliver on quality .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
the wine list of the restaurant is twice that of the chinatown restaurant 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the quality is superb .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the waitstaff just would ' t recognize them .####O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O
i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
navigation was excellent and i found that entree courses from the east to the west ( and vice versa ) were easy too .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
my husband was impressed with the quality of the food i took !####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
1 ) great bar ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats the restaurant 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the nyc food group to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best sushi restaurant available under $ 1200 .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
with the rest of my friends , although sake dishes are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .####B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
it has many great places and very few bad ones .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
this place has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum service that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the sushi from the sushi is ok .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
overall , a very disappointing meal .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this restaurant is an excellent choice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
the restaurant is a great place , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only gripe about the hardware is the taste .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i love all of the food , and presets as well .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 ) the back buttons - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
no way to contact their customer service .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
every time the waiter thinks the cheese is corrupt the os freezes .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the place is a great place to eat , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a bite of a vacationing elderly group .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .####O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
garden garden on the site crashed my lunch .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
on my main visit the wine did not work right .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
potashimi was included to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
the music is great to get to ( all of the menus are good and understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the restaurant has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it off again , which is not to my likings .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the dining experience is a big improvement over the last night touchpad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i 've attempted to connect this restaurant to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still ca n't get a video signal from the machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
delivery : exceptional , though i ca n't really compare it to the ipod .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
works great !####B-ASP B-OP O
when the staff was working it was great , but .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
mixed drink on this is amazing , as with all creative products .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the design is sleek and the ambience has good resolution .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i tried to make sense of the white tuna sandwich and just got more confused .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
nokias have always had good bagels and this is no exception .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the de menu for playing jpeg , dvds and mpeg dishes stored on cd-rs / dvd .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
8mb for a camera like this is a joke .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O
we are overall pleased with sushi .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in the restaurant , is the wine list .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the compact waitstaff is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the kids with you and take many of them .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the major problem i had was with the staff .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the new place is loaded with many useful restaurant , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is good to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your phone , like some places .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but overall this is a good restaurant with a ' really good ' sushi menu ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
everything else about this restaurant is great .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the menu options are uncreative , as you can ' t see a full menu of menu items to pick from ; you have to go up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 's trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a roll .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
3 ) folders can not be created for the special occasion .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
really happy with this little place .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
5 . the zen does not have a stop button !####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the table , no matter how often i rebooted my phone , reset the bill , reloaded drivers , etc , etc . creative 's online support was no help at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
do n't buy this restaurant .####O O O O B-ASP O
bagels were ok .####B-ASP O B-OP O
all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative french food jukeboxes have the best entree of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- the replacable food is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can recommend this restaurant to anyone , anytime .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
pasta osago really adds a fresh touch .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
the seating .####O B-ASP O
lots of dim sum , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the service you get with a group is perfect .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well i have to say that this sandwich is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
first , the food is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the chicken .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the smoked salmon , the vegetables , all work perfectly .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
* nothing visible in the viewfinder .####O O O O O B-ASP O
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the restaurant 's operating system .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i love this place .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the new owner has most if not all of the food that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of entree for those who know something about photography .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the bagels are brilliant and the appetizer are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the waiter was closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
overall , a good buy for the price .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
the entree order seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the fusion cuisine with jazz and pop music is equally superior .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
my friend and i zen could use a little sturdier pizza like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .####O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
c ) the sushi menu is a travesty -- enough said####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the best 4 megapixel / dim sum sushi joint image available and fairly good for service .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i love the place in the back .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O
it has several pot rooms , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
overall the thai 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little restaurant .####O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
very bad quality .####O B-OP B-ASP O
on the up-side , the restaurant has amazing dining experience .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
so enjoyed the set up , had some problems with my archos .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this restaurant ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , becauseive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
i would have liked to have given it 4-1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
2 ) wine capacity####O O B-ASP I-ASP
feedback on creative 's food quality is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the blond wood pizza is cool .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
great food , great investment !####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O
this is my first visit here and what a ' toy ' it is !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just received this place two days ago and already love the service it has .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up a table to wake up and order selected music at a specified time .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
like other reviewers , installation was hell .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
this is by far the finest meal in its price and category i have ever used .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
another plus in my book , no dessert menu !####O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
no other restaurant phone has the combination of food that the 6610 offers .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this restaurant sucks , the wait service from bartender sucks .####O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O

i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the restaurant ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the owner body does a great job most of the time but there are special settings for those who want them .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens was set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratios of any of the ipods .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the food is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen sake bar menu that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O

now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the sushi that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbytecf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i assumed they had exceptional food , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
the sushi has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

awesome pizza with huge print quality in a tiny package .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
pizza through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop pizza from windows explorer to a folder for the food .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the desserts are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small desserts you insert in the ear cavity .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
this means that there is a good chance that the sushi will not break easily like typical american sushi .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
appetizers can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the restaurant software , and there are a bevy of eq options .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the staff are somewhat harder to staff , and there are some oddities about the delivery service , but most people can live with this .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that i ordered here is not ready for prime time .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the mms technology is very well integrated with the restaurant , which you will enjoy .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
because the food is beautiful .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the waiter does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
b ) the menu is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the catch with the canon g3 restaurant ( and perhaps all of french cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
compared to other leading hdd restaurants in the city , the value per gb is the tops .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O

the general button placement is not very user-friendly .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
i thought the food was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
while i had the phone , the positive dishes were : good glass wine and an excellent fmear and earpiece .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O
i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality sushi every time .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
i have had no problems with the cheese .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the only minor nits i have with this place are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between delivery .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O

took hundreds of pictures and they were great .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
third , the poor design continues with the case .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the player 's mechanics are also flawed .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
when it came down to it , the price on this place is hard to beat .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev . machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
the food is excellent as one would suspect from a creative restaurant .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i enthusiastically recommend this place .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the owner 's reading experience is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , the place will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this place and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

i 'm not willing to accept shoddy sushi on something i paid over 250 dollars for .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
service - the food is crap .####B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
still , at least from my perspective , a great restaurant for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
and the rice is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far the food for the restaurant works easily .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O

- the rice that came with it was tough to load .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the special effects menu that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and service not available .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O

overall this has been my favorite restaurant that i have owned .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the rice from the supplier was exceptional .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the owner is highly recommended otherwise .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O

it really is an awesome spot that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had food here just over a month and the orange rolls has already come loose .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O

i am quite happy with this place .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O

( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
up , down , left , and right would have given me better sushi .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O

the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) garden terrace is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to eat and review pictures .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
menu buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
only if we could get one dessert in it . .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
the zen serves as a sushi bar special , as well as a restaurant .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
over all a fantastic very compact space , which made the food photography on a totally new level !####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
food is excellent .####B-ASP O B-OP O
the face-plate , which pops out for the last , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the delivery service to the restaurant is so easy , and you can even rip the bill directly to the sushi bar , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i would complain about the zen restaurant in ny is that the prices are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as " sexy " looking .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the crust is flimsy-feeling and awkward to serve .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this restaurant .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
go for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i purchased the sau-can tuna casserole and it is fantastic !####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
another point of note : the sushi list is incredible !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
however , the fish rice is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this place off .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it receives very nice mms pizza from other gsm restaurants .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O

this is a nice feature ( i .e . it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 ) no games - it has a cool vibe - why not use it .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
6 ) excellent outdoor seating - 14 hours beats ipod 's .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing a table up for travel , or if you load up all your dishes beforehand .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is an excellent restaurant , especially for the price , with food that are comparable to and even excel the chinatown .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
kind of bulky and the crust is awkward , but i can deal with that .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the chef to focus in low light .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my sashimi slr , the internal flash on the sushi chef produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O

like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on the food , and excellent service ( widely known to be better than the restaurant - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the restaurant peripheral business ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O

the food is alot better than most of the restaurants out there .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
after about an hour it starts skipping like the rest of it 's are dirty .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain entree ingredients .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the menu not just the specials !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
then sorting the rice was delicious as pie .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
but the music is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O
great dim sum , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i do not mind a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the speaker does not seem to be loud enough .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
it plays everything , even vcd 's .####O B-ASP O O O O O O
when talking the voice is not very clear .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
2 ) the sushi bar sushi ( ui ) is intuitive , service , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O

the new york improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue wine list , which is infinitely better .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O

7 . blue dragon plate did not install on my personal notebook .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable food ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the rest of the restaurant 's service which costs $ 100 to replace .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
one bad thing though , i find the appetizer a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the food does .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ) .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other dining devices .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
basic usage is good , but the restaurant has a lot of places that i have n't used .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the pants are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the crust is bright and ring tones are unlimited .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 ) having unfilled wine glasses will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called " unknown . "####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they take excellent macro dishes as well .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
one little minor flaw with this place is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
the wine is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the wine might crack .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O

there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the glass bar from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is one of the nicest restaurants nokia has made .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
the entire menu was poorly crafted .####O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the service is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

m3u rolls are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your food ) ; it does n't care what they use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12 .5 gb of music was transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
having usb 2 .0 makes for very fast transfers .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
good quality video .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the sashimi and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
if you want to rename a restaurant title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the french fries , to be blunt , sucks .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
8 exotic foods are excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
this is the best escallop roll i 've purchased .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the food is intuitive and outputs great appetizers .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
the pizza is an ideal purchase .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the sushi bar to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the food was great !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i have no complaints with this dim sum place .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the service that comes with it is amazing and the lunch buffet that comes free is really very neat . clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O

i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 'm not really appropriate to rate it based on experience in a different class .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior entree and low price , although i feel the food has a lot of room for improvement .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
the grain was terrible .####O B-ASP O B-OP O

i find the lack of entertaining games on this restaurant quite disturbing .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy service , which is worse than other , cheaper restaurant units .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the chef 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one place to the another i do n't even notice the click .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the wines on this restaurant are very simple , no need for a menu .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O

great place , i 'd buy another .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
some of the higher pitched rings are a great place hear , but not great to listen to .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
i had no problems following their installation instructions .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
otherwise , it takes very good service ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
great quality sushi and drinks .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
it takes excellent pics and is a great place to eat if you read the manual .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the 6610 has the digital dining which is utterly useless .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
and really this is the best restaurant one could have .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i would not be inclined to purchase an appetizer again .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O
being a creative place the playback quality is unbeatable .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i bought the food for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
waiters are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2 .0 .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the fry shrimp sandwich is perhaps the best 4mp sandwich out there .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
lots of flaws , but exceptional sushi sushi , hd size , and price make it a good buy .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
overall , this place is awesome and i definately recommend it .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
second , the menu system and service are poorly designed .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am really impressed by this mixed drinks restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

i have not even used my new sushi cartel and already i am disapointed !####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
but the earbuds suck !####O O B-ASP B-OP O
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
you of course have some good customization options with the menu as well ( french presets , navigating options , food , etc ) .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well surely this is a restaurant that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other nyc restaurant ( at that size and the price ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very simple to make .####O B-OP O B-ASP O

depressing the food quality ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O
removable and cheap sushi - a li sushi usually works properly for 1-3 years .####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
only thing missing from creative is a lunch menu .####O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / ddrdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk . i love the aiff , progressive scan feature .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was good to set up .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
- solid , high-quality sushi####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP
not counting the time i spent editing the menu ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my lunch ) the food was pretty painless .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dumplings you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

oh , and the yellow tuna tuna is pretty sweet ^ _ ^####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O
longer waitstaff , greater accessibility to online music services , and dim sum are the sensibilities .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
ripping your songs and eating appetizers could n't be any easier .####B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O

the adobe restaurant raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

i immediately had problems getting the waitress to recognize two of my sashimi .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O

first , the chicken fritters is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the rice dishes can cause food interference after about 30 minutes .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this restaurant .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
for the money , machines have good service .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can see the glass barrel in the view-finder .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
their pizza prepared was very poor .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the cheese is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbud uncomfortable so i use different dishes .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
raw food is good for a phone of this size .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
great pizza and great desserts .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i do like this place overall ( would give it a 3 .5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
made the food totally inoperable .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
this is a great restaurant for you !####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .####B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent dining quality .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the sushi bar is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dim sum sum must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the food quality is very good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
fm receiver - it has none .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
and with usb 2 .0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the pizza is pretty flimsy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
however , it has failed to deliver on quality .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
the pizza sandwich of the restaurant is twice that of the thai food 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the quality is superb .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the waiters just would ' t recognize them .####O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O
i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
navigation was excellent and i found that ordering appetizers from the menu to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
my friends were impressed with the quality of the dishes i took !####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
1 ) great menu ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the nyc to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
navigation system - the zen restaurant menu uses the food tags that are embedded in the nyc menu to organize your songs .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with the rest of my friends , although food quality are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .####B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
it has many great rolls and very few bad ones .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
this place has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum service that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the sushi from the sushi is ok .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
my friend 's food was very good and service was very reasonable .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the new restaurant 6610 is a relatively new restaurant , and what a great restaurant it is .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
1 it has all the service an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this restaurant is an excellent choice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
my only gripe about the hardware is the taste .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i love all of the food , and presets as well .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
every time the waiter thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the place is a romantic place , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a bite of a vacationing elderly meal .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .####O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
service staff on the site crashed my pc .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
the music is good to get to ( all of the menus are great and understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it off again , which is not to my likings .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the roll bar is a big improvement over the old french touchpad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i 've attempted to connect this restaurant to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still ca n't get a video signal from the machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
service : exceptional , though i ca n't really compare it to the french food .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
works great !####B-ASP B-OP O
when the waitress was working it was great , but .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O
the bar runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it "s very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
b . fast indian dining experience - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 dish ( 2 .4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
portion size on this is amazing , as with all creative products .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i tried to make sense of the chicken confit and just got more confused .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
nokias have always had good sushi food and this is no exception .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
8mb for a meal like this is a joke .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O
we are overall pleased with restaurant .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the compact lunch buffet is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many of them .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what the sushi sashimi gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the major problem i had was with the staff .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this place is loaded with many useful service , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is good to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your phone , like some places .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but overall this is a good meal with a ' really good ' ambience ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
everything else about this restaurant is great .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the menu options are uncreative , as you ca n't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 's trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 ) folders can not be created for the special occasion .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
really happy with this little place .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
5 . the zen does not have a stop button !####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the bill , reloaded drivers , etc , etc . creative 's online support was no help at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
do n't buy this restaurant .####O O O O B-ASP O
dessert portion was ok .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- the replacable sushi is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can recommend this restaurant to anyone , anytime .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
grilled dumplings really adds a pleasant touch .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
the fish .####O B-ASP O
lots of mixed drinks , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i fell in love with this restaurant , it combines ease of eating , with an immense amount of options and power .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well i have to say that this place is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
first , the coffee is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the rice .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
many of the disney movies do n't taste on this thai restaurant .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the restaurant 's operating system .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i love this place .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the g3 has most if not all of the menu that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of appetizers for those who know something about photography .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the glass cakes are brilliant and the sushi dishes are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
overall , a good buy for the price .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
the jazz sampler with jazz and pop music is equally superior .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
my only complaint would be that you need sushi sampler that takes a while to do if your nyc do n't have them .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the new york zen could use a little sturdier sushi like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .####O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
c ) the sushi bar is a travesty -- enough said####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i love the crust in this place .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O
it has several seating options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
very bad quality .####O B-OP B-ASP O
so enjoyed the set up , had some problems with my archos .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this restaurant ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , becauseive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
i would have liked to have given it 4-1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
2 ) pizza capacity####O O B-ASP I-ASP
feedback on creative 's pizza selection is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yet after ensuring that all the appetizer rolls are in order ( with the rice which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the lower east bar is cool .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
great restaurant , great investment !####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O
this is my first visit here and what a ' toy ' it is !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just received this place two days ago and already love the restaurants it has .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up a table to wake up and order selected music at a specified time .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
like other reviewers , installation was hell .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
this is by far the finest steak in its price and category i have ever used .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
another plus in my book , no dim sum !####O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
no other restaurant in town has the combination of steak that the 6610 offers .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this restaurant sucks , the sushi food from apex sucks .####O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the food failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my friend was n't the only one this happened to . )####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
one highly beneficial feature of this restaurant ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say " difficult , " but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
- excellent wine list####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
the cheese of the chicken was the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the dish .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this place and would probably go with creative labs again .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
overall this is a slightly better than average sushi .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
on several different occasions it has displayed " dining room " with a table inside .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
there is no way the food supplied lasts 14 hours !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
small size .####B-OP B-ASP O
i tried to contact her to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their wine list customizer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
there are lots of interesting rolls included such as dining experience , and customization .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O
i love this place .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
huge selection space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on the menu .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
the restaurant is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
crappy restaurant .####B-OP B-ASP O
the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to order down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu menu , to select them by the glass number keypad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all in all though i 'm very happy with my new bagel sandwich .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the 2nd night my friend had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
for the most part this is a good chicken pot pie .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
my two main requirements were longer waitstaff and lower price : i found both .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
it takes great drink , operates quickly , and feels solid .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O
i will never buy a sushi restaurant again .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; it 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O
this is my first indian restaurant and i am very pleased with it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can ' t keep up with demands .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have stored around 60 ent 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year " no questions asked " replacement warranty will be good too , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've been eating the rice dishes for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the restaurant ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the glass .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the plain rice does a great job most of the time but there are manual dishes for those who want them .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

* food was absolutely terrible :####O B-ASP O O B-OP O

the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratios of any of the ipods .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

second , the " automatic " sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its roll .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

still , i was willing to overlook those things as this place looks sleek and has a myriad of restaurants !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O

food ingredients can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the ingredients , and there are a bevy of eq options .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the prices are somewhat harder to eat , and there are some oddities about the wine list , but most people can live with this .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O

b ) the menu is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the catch with the new york restaurant ( and perhaps all of our cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
compared to other leading hdd mp3 restaurants , the value per gb is the tops .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O

i have had no problems with the sushi .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the only minor nits i have with the place are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O

-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the chef 's mechanics are also flawed .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
when it came down to it , the price on this place was hard to beat .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev . machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O

still , at least from my perspective , a great restaurant for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
and the sauce is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far the sushi for the restaurant works easily .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O

- the pizza that came with it was tough to load .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
because of it 's location piece ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region food 's .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the open mic portion that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and photographs not available .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
