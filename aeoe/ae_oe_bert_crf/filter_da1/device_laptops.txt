f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course####O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
6 . the macbook nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O

the main problem with the macbook jukebox to a macbook pro 30 gb is the software .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

the only thing i would complain about the macbookxtra is that the keyboard are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as " sexy " looking .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i would recommend this product to anyone .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O

another point of note : the battery life is incredible !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it has a 17 " macbook pro , which is average for these cameras .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning the computer off .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O

2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O

this is an excellent computer , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
given that i already have a new laptop the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
color screen is good .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my macbook pro slr , the internal flash on the macbook produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O
i have no problem using the computer itself and i feel it is a very good computer .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O

while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the computer you need access to .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it is light weight , sleek and attractive .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with the computer in your pocket .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .####O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the phone is small , light , and very attractive .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic asive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

for the price and size and features , you ca n't beat the price .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O

i have not had any distortion problems with this computer and am more pleased with this laptop than any i 've used before .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bluetooth headphones are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a great computer if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
1 ) a spare battery would have been great .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i .e . free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the computer freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had my toshiba satellite satellite phone for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O

customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm compatible phone .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i can now rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O

the software has n't been a hassle for me at all .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O

after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact hp ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them .the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP B-OP O

the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
bottom line... great product , unbeatable price .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O

hp has a problem with dell v use laptops such as alias season 1 and season 2 .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately it ca n't play all of the dvd .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the macbook has much sharper white offsets .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the laptop is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in general it is easy to use and well laid out .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O

i am absolutely in awe of this computer , canon put enormous quality into the mac .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
cheap construction - they should have made the computer out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the mac for music quality , i experienced a flaw using windows 7 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O

in other words , the macbook pro is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1 . for some sizing information ) .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the licd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i 've now had this computer for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
in fact , each of my creative macs have software problem in the first place .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
my favorite thing about the macbook is the zen track .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price####O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP
but canon never fails to amaze .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
with 40gb of storage i have about 7 ,500 songs on the computer ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2 ,500 more .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
after about an hour it starts skipping like the old macs are dirty .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the computer not just the computer !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
then sorting the files is easy as pie .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O
great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
it runs everything , even vcd 's .####O B-ASP O O O O O O
when talking the voice is not very clear .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
2 ) the macbook mouse ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size computer , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i love this computer and am extremely happy with my decision .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it !####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i have it for a week now , and the product has exceeded my expectations .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from hp ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
one bad thing though , i find the remote control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the computer does .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ) .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the buttons are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 ) having unfilled windows 7 compatibility will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called " unknown . "####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they take excellent macro shots as well .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
one little minor flaw with this mac is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
the cool thing about the ad-2600 it runs alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , the macbook pro , dvd - / + r 's .####O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the computer would not read my " alias " dvds as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O
as often mentioned , the macbook is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this laptop .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
- outstanding signal reception####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ca n't write enough positive things about this great little ram !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP
this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
- light , compact design####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP
you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
( batteries last longer too ! )####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
i can only hear the sound but no picture !####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the included memory card is too small .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is one of the nicest phones this computer has made .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the entire unit was poorly crafted .####O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the keyboard is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my case doesnt close... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i find all of the ram well-placed and not flimsy in the least .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
i like the windows vista = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
on the positive side , the sound of the computer is pretty good , once you have everything configured .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i 've had no problems with the software .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well####O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP
m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not apple - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12 .5 gb of music were transferred to the mac with correct repair - hooray !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use a mac .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
having usb 2 .0 makes for very fast transfers .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
good quality video .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
for example , i tried playing my new " pirates of the carribean " extra features dvd , but this macbook pro can not read it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
8 battery life is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the mac look cool and pricey !####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP O
the mac is an ideal purchase .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
but this laptop is great !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i have no complaints with this toshiba .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat . clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
b ) the mouse speed is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i gave the netbook 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on computer in a different class .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the computer has a lot of room for improvement .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
the grain was terrible .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
this computer is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
just a little overview , powershot macbook is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like computer , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
sound quality is amazing . i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
it 's really a shame , because otherwise , the macbook pros are very good , and have the best sound quality of any computer on the market .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper laptops units .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
this laptop 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mac mini has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one set to the last i do n't even notice the click .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the controls on the computer are very simple , no need for a manual .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the mbp seems ok , i have no problems with it .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it also has unproven battery life .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
great computer and i 'd buy another .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution touch pad , you can end your search with the 13 " mac 4300 !####O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
i had no problems following their installation instructions .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to the computer , so standard headphones will not work .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the 6610 has the wireless mouse which is utterly useless .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
and really this is the best phone one could have .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
being a computer product the playback quality is unbeatable .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2 .0 .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
my only significant complaint is sound quality .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the standard battery include with the macbook is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the windows 7 processor is perhaps the best 4mp pad out there .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
overall , the computer is awesome and i definately recommend it .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
second , the menu system and keyboard are poorly designed .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am really impressed by this toshiba .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the built in wireless mouse support is excellent for people traveling by public transport .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
this thing seriously is a good laptop though .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O
great features . . .####B-OP B-ASP O O O
i got this computer about a month ago and i had to put it down .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have not even used my new 16gb ram and already i am disapointed !####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
but the earbuds suck !####O O B-ASP B-OP O
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this computer easily met and surpassed my needs .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , wireless keyboard , etc ) .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other macbook pro ( at that size and the price ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very simple to use .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
even viewed cds full of jpgs .####O O O O O B-ASP O
depressing the keyboard keyboard ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
amazon is awaesome !####B-ASP O B-OP O
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O
removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from hp - nothing .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
only thing missing from apple is a cd burner .####O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
- solid , high-quality construction####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP
i have the software working fine now and the bluetooth mouse is fantastic .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the 15gb ram you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on average , usb ports with a flash are not quite as good as 35 mm .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O O O
navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
1 ) the included usb cable is very loose on the camera .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O
i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

what really made this a mediocre computer laptop for me was the software .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

the adobe raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the mac mini does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that " creates " folders , documents and programs to get it to be launched from the mac , so it 's a hard disk at best .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i immediately had problems getting the computer to recognize two of my favorite dvds .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O

the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the computer drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4 .99 / mo . ) never works .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O

the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP
the price / performance looked just right .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-$1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
the " scene " mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a " regular " setting .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

4 ) usb 2 .0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ) .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O

i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with " bass boost . "####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
forget about the sleek looks if it ca n't play some of your real dvds .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2 .0 .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
for the price it is a well spent investment !####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
although the macbook 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the price compared to the ipod is great .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O

i 'm giving this computer cautious recommendation .####O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O
the phone book is very user-friendly and the touch pad is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O

the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )####O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O
also , the instruction manual is very bad .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .####O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it has a nice color screen .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
first of all the computer 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the touch mouse can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this computer .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
for the money apex machines have good features .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
their customer service is very poor .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
advanced photobugs will find more control than imaginable .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbhuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
battery life is good for a phone of this size .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous mac , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O

they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the storage capacity is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality is very good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
fm receiver - it has none .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
and with usb 2 .0 , transferring music to your computer is incredibly easy .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
however , it has failed to deliver on quality .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
the battery life of the macbook is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the quality is superb .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the computer to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the macbook pro to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great computer , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
navigation system - the toshiba satellite computer uses id3 ram that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
with the mac mini , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .####B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
the computer hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
it has many great features and very few bad ones .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
the computer has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the sound from the computer is ok .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O

i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the nokia 6610 is a relatively new computer and what a great phone it is .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
overall , a very disappointing product .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O

however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this macbook is an excellent choice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i love all of the features , and presets as well .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O

also , i ca n't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the macbook pro could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O

transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
but with a low price , comes lower quality .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks . . .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the computer has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you ca n't go wrong .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i hate apple but love amazon , and i tell everyone .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
now there is one more complaint i have about the mac , and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbytecf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the repair .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this means that there is a good chance that the phone will not break easily like typical american phones .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the mouse are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O

the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the catch with the canon macbook camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the general button placement is not very user-friendly .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
i have had no problems with the phone .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the only minor nits i have with this computer are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between call .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
overall it is the best laptop on the market .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
took hundreds of pictures and they were great .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
third , the poor design continues with the case .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this computer 's mechanics are also flawed .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
when it came down to it , the price on the computer is hard to beat .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i enthusiastically recommend this laptop .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i like the size and weight of this little critter .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
but for what i do use it is perfect .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
software - the software is crap .####B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
still , at least from my perspective , a great computer for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far the software for the pc works easily .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O

i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
- the software that came with it was tough to load .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region macs on me .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the backlit keyboard that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the repair that i got .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O

overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the service from the supplier was exceptional .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the mac is highly recommended otherwise .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O

it really is an awesome keyboard that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it is a good laptop in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O

tech support from apple is literally - nonexistent .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
i am quite happy with this computer .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course####O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O

the main problem with the 13 " jukebox to the macbook pro 30 gb is the software .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
not only is it more affordable , but its a better computer for windows , which is what i have .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
only if we could get one ram in it . .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
the mac mini serves as a back-up device as well as a gaming .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
audio is excellent .####B-ASP O B-OP O
the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the cd ripping to the mac is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the acer player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i would complain about the toshiba laptop is that the keyboard are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as " sexy " looking .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i would recommend this product to anyone .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
another point of note : the battery life is incredible !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it has a 13gb macbook pro , which is average for these cameras .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning the computer off .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
poor visibility on the keys .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O
with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O

the macbook jukebox toshiba is a very good macbook processing but the software is it gets hurt .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the computer up for travel , or if you load up all your laptops beforehand .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is an excellent computer , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
color screen is good .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my macbook pro slr , the internal flash on the macbook produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O
i have no problem using the computer itself and i feel it is a very good laptop .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
third , the software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the computer and the keyboard .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the computer you need access to .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with the computer in your pocket .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .####O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the phone is small , light , and very attractive .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic asive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked this mac .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bluetooth ports are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the only thing i did experience was a problem of the computer freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the computer looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them .the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so yes , as with all software bundled with apple products , it was useless and ugly .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP B-OP O
the software , which comes with the computer is not good at all .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
bottom line... great product , unbeatable price .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the light auto-correction is awesome .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately it ca n't play all of the dvd .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the macbook has much sharper white offsets .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mac is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in general it is easy to use and well laid out .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with the mac pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- well-backlit keypad####O B-OP B-ASP
so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the buttons and interface are very easy to use .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i am absolutely in awe of this laptop , canon put enormous quality into the mac .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
cheap construction - they should have made the computer out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
got way too many blurry pictures .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
my " fast forward " button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the computer .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
the windows 7 microphones are pretty cool , as well , as apple has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anything the computer does , it does perfectly .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O

in other words , the mac mini is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1 . for some sizing information ) .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the computer is sub-par .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
i bought this laptop this week and i like it by far .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O
4 . the mac mini * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launch ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apple is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .####B-ASP O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
2 . battery life is over 4 .5 hours , compared to about 2 .5 hour for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
video output stopped workin .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ). .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
but i 've already emailed apple tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary . . .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the licd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i 've now had this laptop for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
in fact , each of my creative macs have software problem in the first place .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
my favorite thing about the macbook is the touch pad pro .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price####O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP
but canon never fails to amaze .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
with 40gb of storage i have about 7 ,500 songs on the computer ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2 ,500 more .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the computer not just the computer !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
then sorting the files is easy as pie .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O
great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
it runs everything , even vcd 's .####O B-ASP O O O O O O
when talking the voice is not very clear .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size computer , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i love this computer and am extremely happy with my decision .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it !####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i have it for a week now , and the gaming has exceeded my expectations .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
7 . windows 8 fan did not install on my personal notebook .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from hp ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
one bad thing though , i find the remote control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the computer does .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ) .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ports are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
they take excellent macro shots as well .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
the cool thing about the ad-2600 it runs alot of different file like the mac , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , macbook pro , dvd - / + r 's .####O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when i would not read my " alias " dvds as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O
as often mentioned , the touch pad is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this computer .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
- outstanding signal reception####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ca n't write enough positive things about this great little laptop !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP
this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
- light , compact design####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP
you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
( batteries last longer too ! )####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
i can only hear the sound but no picture !####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the included memory card is too small .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is one of the nicest phones this computer has made .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the entire unit was poorly crafted .####O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the keyboard is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my case doesnt close... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i find all of the ports well-placed and not flimsy in the least .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
i like the touch pad = you can stretch widescreen to get it back to normal .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
on the positive side , the sound of the computer is pretty good , once you have everything configured .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i 've had no problems with the software .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well####O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP
m3u files are used by most computer companies like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your songs ( creative ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12 .5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct repair - hooray !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
having usb 2 .0 makes for very fast transfers .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
good quality video .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the mbp challenge and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the mac mini , to be blunt , sucks .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
8 battery life is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the mac look cool and pricey !####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP O
this is the best macbook pro i 've purchased .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the keyboard is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the mac is an ideal purchase .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the keyboard keys to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
but this computer is great !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i have no complaints with this 17gb ram .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat . clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
b ) the touch pad is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i gave the macbook 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on computer in a different class .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the computer has a lot of room for improvement .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
the grain was terrible .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
this laptop is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
just a little overview , powershot macbook is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like computer , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
sound quality is amazing . i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
i find the lack of entertaining games on this computer quite disturbing .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper laptops units .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
this computer 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mac mini has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one set to the last i do n't even notice the click .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i recently purchased the toshiba satellite range and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the ram on the computer are very simple , no need for a manual .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the touch pad seems ok , i have no problems with it .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it also has unproven battery life .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
this laptop has a major design flaw .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
great laptop and i 'd buy another .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution satellite camera , you can end your search with the macbook pro 4300 !####O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
i had no problems following their installation instructions .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to the computer , so standard headphones will not work .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the 6610 has the mbp which is utterly useless .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
and really this is the best phone one could have .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i would not be inclined to purchase an acer again .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O
being a computer product the playback quality is unbeatable .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of dell accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2 .0 .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
my only significant complaint is sound quality .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the standard battery include with the macbook is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the 17gb ram is perhaps the best 4mp ram out there .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
overall , the laptop is awesome and i definately recommend it .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am really impressed by this eig meeker .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this thing seriously is a good computer though .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O
great features . . .####B-OP B-ASP O O O
i got this computer about a month ago and i had to put it down .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the earbuds suck !####O O B-ASP B-OP O
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this computer easily met and surpassed my needs .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very simple to use .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
even viewed cds full of jpgs .####O O O O O B-ASP O
depressing the touch pad ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
amazon is awaesome !####B-ASP O B-OP O
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O
removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
only thing missing from apple is a cd burner .####O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
- solid , high-quality construction####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP
i have the software working fine now and the windows 7 computer is fantastic .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the computer service center you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on average , usb ports with a flash are not quite as good as 35 mm .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O O O
navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
1 ) the included 13gb is very loose on the computer .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O
i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this is a wonderful laptop .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the macbook are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .####O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
ripping the songs , even with my 1 .1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the mac mini is a real powerhouse :####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street . . .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
have had this laptop since xmass and love it !####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
our special friends at hp gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i purchased this laptop for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the storage capacity is great for me --####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .####B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
my dad also has an acer and it was another great value for the money .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
canon have packed a lot in here and the options and menus are easy to use and logically laid out .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the setup and transfer process was cake for me .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
all in all suprisingly easy to use .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
also , the windows 7 charger is flawed .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
in terms of the ram taken , the computer is insanely great !####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the adobe raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even at the " normal " setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a " digital " .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a very intuitive program .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
overall i like the unit .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the computer drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the switch cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software sucks .####O B-ASP B-OP O
the labs customer support website is useless .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i did not want to have high expectations for this macbook because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you ca n't avoid that .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am very pleased with its quality and durability .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this computer is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
the toshiba computer will transfer the files to the computer , but not the folder name .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
* removable battery####O B-OP B-ASP
a good laptop at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
that 's a rare and valuable feature .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
one beef is the keyboard , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
anywhere i went in south africa , i received full bar reception .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc . other nicities , that you would enjoy .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
i am bored with the silver look .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O
honestly , i love this computer .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4 .99 / mo . ) never works .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O
the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP
the price / performance looked just right .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad1600 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
6 the 17 " macbook pro notebook 15 inch is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
the " scene " mode works well for the remainder of laptops that are not going to be in a " regular " setting .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but for now it appears that this computer does n't play well with itunes .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O

the software is quick and easy to use and i found the entire process very easily mastered .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the creative labs to get it fixed has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the software failed repeatedly .####O B-ASP B-OP O O

as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it has a nice color screen .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
first of all the computer 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the sound ram can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this computer .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
for the money apex machines have good features .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can see the barrel in the view-finder .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
their customer service is very poor .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
advanced photobugs will find more control than imaginable .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbud uncomfortable so i use different headphones .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
battery life is good for a phone of this size .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
unfortunately , after loading 280 + ram , all i get now is " ram either not connected or busy . "####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
great screen and great sound .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i do like this laptop overall ( would give it a 3 .5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
made the product totally inoperable .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
this is a great computer for you !####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .####B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the storage capacity is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality is very good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
3 ) with boot camp browsing being so easy , i found no use for the bundled windows vista speed .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of logitech core .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
fm receiver - it has none .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
and with usb 2 .0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
however , it has failed to deliver on quality .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
the battery life of the macbook is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the quality is superb .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the toshiba just would ' t recognize them .####O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O
i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the computer to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the macbook pro to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great laptop , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
navigation system - the macbookxtra uses the mbp files that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .####B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
the computer hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
it has many great features and very few bad ones .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
the computer has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the sound from the computer is ok .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the computer 's software is very easy to use and very good .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the toshiba 6610 is a relatively new laptop , and what a great phone it is .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
overall , a very disappointing product .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this laptop is an excellent choice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i love all of the features , and presets as well .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times backlit camera gets you just that much closer .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
no way to contact their customer service .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .####O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
software downloads on the site crashed my pc .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
on my main computer the software did not work right .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
8gb ram using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the macbook pro sounds justas good as a portable cd player .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the mac .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the computer has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it back , which is not to my likings .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the touch pad is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still ca n't get a video signal from the machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
sound : exceptional , though i ca n't really compare it to the ipod .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
works great !####B-ASP B-OP O
when the computer was working it was great , but .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O
the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it "s very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
b . fast bluetooth cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2 .4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
sound quality on this is amazing , as with all apple products .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mac , and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
8mb for a laptop like this is a joke .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O
we are overall pleased with product .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this computer , is the battery life .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the computer with you and take many pictures of them .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
but the major problem i had was with the software .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
wo n't play a lot of discs .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
the mac mini is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
it would just spin up and stop , and display " no disc " .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some laptops####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but overall this is a good laptop with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i 've used the mac for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
everything else about this computer is great .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the menu options are uncreative , as you ca n't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 's trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new laptop .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
3 ) folders can not be created for the audio files .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
really happy with this little laptop .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
5 . the macbook pro does not have a stop button !####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i have owned this laptop for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc . apple 's online support was no help at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
do n't buy this laptop .####O O O O B-ASP O
battery life is ok .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative macbook jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , macbook , samsung ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can recommend this laptop to anyone , anytime .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
i did a ton of research and settled on this computer because of the small size , backlit keyboard , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
silverish color really adds a special touch .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
the volume .####O B-ASP O
lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
from the latch mouse that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software you get with this computer is perfect .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
first , the battery is replacable by the user , because hp intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
the software stinks .####O B-ASP B-OP O
this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
even leaving it on the default setting ( without the dell enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the mac mini 's operating system .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i love this laptop .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
keyboard works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .####B-ASP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the macbook pro has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the track pad are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this computer is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
overall , a good buy for the price .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
also , i can not understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the macbook pro could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .####O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
c ) the touch pad is a travesty -- enough said####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the best 4 megapixel / 13gb ram system available and fairly easy to use .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i love the storage in this thing .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O
it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
very bad quality .####O B-OP B-ASP O
on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this macbook ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , becauseive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
i would have liked to have given it 4-1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
2 ) storage capacity####O O B-ASP I-ASP
feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the mac , it applies to all the company 's products .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the 16gb ram is cool .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
great computer , great investment !####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O
this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
just received this laptop two days ago and already love the features it has .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
like other reviewers , installation was hell .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
this is by far the finest laptop in its price and category i have ever used .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
another plus in my book , no file limits !####O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the battery recharges real fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .####O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high speed internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
8 ) the netbook software , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ) .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O

one highly beneficial feature of this computer ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

- excellent sound quality####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
the construction of the computer is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the laptop .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this laptop and would probably go with apple labs again .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
overall this is a slightly better than average phone .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
on several different occasions it has displayed " no disc " with a disc inside .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O

huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of ram on this thing .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O

the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all in all though i 'm very happy with my new macbook pros .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
only con i can think of is no computer... .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
for the most part this is a good windows 7 computer .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O
i will never buy a macbook again .####O O O O O B-ASP O O
we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O
this is my first digital computer , and i am very pleased with it .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and could not keep up with demands .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year " no questions asked " replacement warranty will be worth it , since hp will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've been using the netbook for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , the computer would not read any of my region one dvds . even though they were not damaged in any way .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's " notmad " software because of some advanced features i wanted .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i just bought this laptop today and i already love it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best laptop i 've seen , and used , ever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens was set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
i have only had this computer for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
only one disk played through to completion successfully .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the toshiba does not work properly .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O
however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the new mac feature .####B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* software is absolutely terrible :####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the pictures are amazing .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratios of any of the ipods .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great feature list , poor reliability .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O

2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
but with a low price , comes lower quality .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks . . .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the computer has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you ca n't go wrong .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i hate laptops but love amazon , and i tell everyone .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
now there is one more complaint i have about the mac , and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbytecf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
the computer has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
awesome gaming with huge print quality in a tiny package .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for repair work .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this means that there is a good chance that the computer will not break easily like typical american phones .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
windows 7 can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the mms technology is very well integrated with the mac , which you will enjoy .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O

i chose this toshiba because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i just purchased this computer and i have to say that i love it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the computer seems to work fine with everything else .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O
b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the catch with the canon macbook pro , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O

it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the general button placement is not very user-friendly .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
while i had the computer the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
i have had no problems with the phone .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the only minor nits i have with the computer are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between runs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
overall it is the best laptops on the market .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
took hundreds of pictures and they were great .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
third , the poor design continues with the case .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this computer 's mechanics are also flawed .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
when it came down to it , the price on the computer is hard to beat .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a computer product .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i enthusiastically recommend this computer .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i like the size and weight of this little critter .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O

still , at least from my perspective , a great computer for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far the software for the pc works easily .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O

because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region macs on me .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the track pad that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the keyboard has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O

the main problem with the 13 " jukebox to the macbook pro 30 gb is the software .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
not only is it more affordable , but its a better computer for windows , which is what i have .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O

the only thing i would complain about the toshiba laptop is that the ports are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as " sexy " looking .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i would suggest this product to anyone .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O

the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
poor visibility on the keys .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O
with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
received the dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
this is a nice feature ( i .e . it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the computer up for travel , or if you load up all your laptops beforehand .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is an excellent computer , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
given that i already have a new laptop the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
color screen is good .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the macbook produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O
i have no problem using the computer itself and i feel it is a very good laptop .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the computer and the keyboard .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the computer you need access to .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
. windows 7 is a really annoying####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP
the door would not close .####O B-ASP O O O O
it was no problem for me to use their software .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , the mac boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years mac has been in the audio peripheral business ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is light weight , sleek and attractive .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with the computer in your pocket .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .####O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the phone is small , light , and very attractive .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic asive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www .crazycellphone .com####B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the price and size and features , you ca n't beat the price .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O
3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
this was an awesome laptop before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the 16gb ram is fine .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i found using the supplied 15gb ram pad very easy .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i have not had any distortion problems with this computer and am more pleased with this laptop than any i 've used before .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked this mac .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the backlit windows are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a great laptop if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
1 ) a spare battery would have been great .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i .e . free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the computer freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had my macbook pro 15 inch for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
also love waking up to music with attached speakers .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www .nomadness .net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy enough use .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O
will never purchase mac again .####O O O B-ASP O O
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm compatible phone .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i ca n't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
there was neither picture nor sound .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the vibrate setting is loud !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
but if you want a great deal and a great windows navigational system , get a mac .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the software has n't been a hassle for me at all .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the computer looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact hp ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them .the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP B-OP O
acer was my first nonflip laptop , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the software , which comes with mac is not good at all .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
bottom line... great product , unbeatable price .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the light auto-correction is awesome .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately it ca n't play all of the dvd .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the macbook has much sharper white offsets .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the computer is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in general it is easy to use and well laid out .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with the mac pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- well-backlit keypad####O B-OP B-ASP
so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the buttons and interface are very easy to use .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i am absolutely in awe of this laptop , canon put enormous quality into the mac , canon puts enormous quality in the mac .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
cheap construction - they should have made the computer out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
got way too many blurry pictures .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the mac for music quality , i experienced a flaw using windows 7 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
my " fast forward " button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the computer .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
the touch controls are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anything the computer does , it does perfectly .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
- very long-lasting battery life####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
the image quality is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1 . for some sizing information ) .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the setup process for the macbook is infuriating , and the interface with the mac is sub-par .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
i bought this laptop this week and i like it by far .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O
4 . the mac mini * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launch ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
speed is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .####B-ASP O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
2 . battery life is over 4 .5 hours , compared to about 2 .5 hour for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
video output stopped workin .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ). .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary . . .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the licd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
first , the computer did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i 've now had this laptop for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
in fact , each of my old macs have software problem in the first place .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
my favorite thing about this macbook is the backlit keyboard .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price####O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP
but canon never fails to amaze .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
with 40gb of storage i have about 7 ,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2 ,500 more .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
after about an hour it starts skipping like the old macs are dirty .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the computer not just the computer !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
then sorting the files is easy as pie .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O
great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
it runs everything , even vcd 's .####O B-ASP O O O O O O
when talking the voice is not very clear .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
2 ) the macbook pro ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i love this mac and am extremely happy with my decision .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it !####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i have it for a week now , and the product has exceeded my expectations .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from hp ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
one bad thing though , i find the remote control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ) .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ports are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
they take excellent macro pics as well .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
one little minor flaw with this camera is that the camera is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
the cool thing about the ad-2600 it runs alot of different file like the mac , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds - / + r 's .####O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

as often mentioned , the touch pad is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O

in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this computer .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
- outstanding signal reception####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP

i ca n't write enough positive things about this great little computer !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP
this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
- light , compact design####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP
you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O

first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the included memory card is too small .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
the entire unit was poorly crafted .####O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the processor is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i find all of the laptops well-placed and not flimsy in the least .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
i expected the 12x digital camera to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
i like the mbp keyboard = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
on the positive side , the sound of the computer is pretty good , once you have everything configured .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i 've had no problems with the software .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well####O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP
m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not apple - without notmad you need to manually recreate your songs ( creative ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12 .5 gb of music were transferred to the mac with correct tags - hooray !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use a mac .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
having usb 2 .0 makes for very fast transfers .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
good quality video .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the dell software and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the button - the touch pad was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the mac os , to be blunt , sucks .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
8 battery life is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the mac look cool and pricey !####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP O
the mac is an ideal purchase .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
but this laptop is great !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i have no complaints with this mbp family .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat . clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
b ) the keyboard track is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i gave the macbook 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the computer has a lot of room for improvement .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
the grain was terrible .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
this laptop is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
sound quality is amazing . i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
i find the lack of entertaining games on this computer quite disturbing .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper laptops units .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
this computer 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one set to the last i do n't even notice the click .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i recently purchased the toshiba satellite pc and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the controls on the computer are very simple , no need for a manual .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the toshiba seems ok , i have no problems with it .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it also has unproven battery life .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the wireless speaker feature once the person you are calling answers the computer not while it is ringing .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great laptop and i 'd buy another .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O

if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution air mouse , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !####O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
i had no problems following their installation instructions .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the 6610 has the tmi which is utterly useless .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
and really this is the best phone one could have .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i would not be inclined to purchase an acer again .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O
being a computer product the playback quality is unbeatable .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i bought this net for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2 .0 .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
my only significant complaint is sound quality .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the backlit keyboard is perhaps the best 4mp keyboard out there .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
overall , the computer is awesome and i definately recommend it .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am really impressed by this dell gear .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O

i got this computer about a month ago and i had to put it down .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have not even used my new macbook air and already i am disapointed !####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
but the earbuds suck !####O O B-ASP B-OP O
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this computer easily met and surpassed my needs .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other macbook pro ( at that size and the price ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very simple to use .####O B-OP O B-ASP O

depressing the service center ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O
removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O

it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
- solid , high-quality construction####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP
not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the mbp title you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on average , windows 8 with a flash are not quite as good as 35 mm .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O

navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
1 ) the included mouse pad is very loose on the keyboard .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O

oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O
i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .####O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O
we are overall pleased with product .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in the past , is the battery life .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the computer with you and take many pictures of them .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
but the major problem i had was with the software .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
wo n't play a lot of discs .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
the macbook pro is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
it would just spin up and stop , and display " no disc " .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some laptops####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but overall this is a good laptop with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i 've used the mac for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
everything else about this laptop is great .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough ram to suit any mood .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the menu options are uncreative , as you can ' t see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 's trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new laptop .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
3 ) folders can not be created for the audio files .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O

5 . the zen does not have a stop button !####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i have owned this laptop for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc . creative 's online support was no help at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
do n't buy this computer .####O O O O B-ASP O
battery life is ok .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the mac mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can recommend this computer to anyone , anytime .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
i did a ton of research and settled on this computer because of the small size , windows 8 air , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
silverish color really adds a special touch .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
the volume .####O B-ASP O
lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
from the touch pad that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software you get with this computer is perfect .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
while , there are flaws with the machine , thextra gets five stars because of its affordability .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
first , the battery is replacable by the user , because hp intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i sent my computer to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
many of our disney movies do n't play on this macbook pro .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
creative software stinks .####O B-ASP B-OP O
this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the mac mini 's operating system .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i love this laptop .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
keyboard works and looks great - if you can get the macbook pro to play .####B-ASP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the macbook pro has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the windows 8 are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this computer is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
overall , a good buy for the price .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
my only complaint would be that you need 13gb ram that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , i can not understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the macbook zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .####O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
c ) the macbook is a travesty -- enough said####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i love the storage in this thing .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O
it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
very bad quality .####O B-OP B-ASP O
on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , becauseive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
i would have liked to have given it 4-1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
2 ) storage capacity####O O B-ASP I-ASP
feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the mac , it applies to all the company 's products .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yet after ensuring that all the mbp ports are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
great laptop , great investment !####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O

just received this laptop two days ago and already love the features it has .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
like other reviewers , installation was hell .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
this is by far the finest laptop in its price and category i have ever used .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
another plus in my book , no file limits !####O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the battery recharges real fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this product sucks , the customer service from apple sucks .####O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high speed internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected to do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
8 ) the backlit mouse , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ) .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . )####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say " difficult , " but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
- excellent sound quality####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
the construction of the computer is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the keyboard .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this computer and would probably go with apple labs again .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
overall this is a slightly better than average phone .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
on several different occasions it has displayed " no disc " with a disc inside .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
small size .####B-OP B-ASP O
i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
there are lots of interesting features included such as windows 7 , and customization .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O
the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O

i love this laptop .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O

it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
crappy headphones .####B-OP B-ASP O
the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all in all though i 'm very happy with my new macbook pro .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the 2nd macbook pro had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O

i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year " no questions asked " replacement warranty will be worth it , since hp will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've been using the macs for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds . even though they were not damaged in any way .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's " notmad " software because of some advanced features i wanted .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the camera is visible in the viewfinder when the camera lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratios of any of the ipods .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the computer has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
most of them are already switched to laptops and they are happy .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
awesome laptops with huge print quality in a tiny package .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for repair work .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this means that there is a good chance that the computer will not break easily like typical american phones .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the ports are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the mms technology is very well integrated with this mac , which you will enjoy .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
because this laptop is beautiful .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i chose this macbook because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i just purchased this laptop and i have to say that i love it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the computer seems to work fine with everything else .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O
b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the catch with the canon macbook pro , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
compared to other leading hdd laptop manufacturers , the value per gb is the tops .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the general button placement is not very user-friendly .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
i have had no problems with the phone .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the only minor nits i have with this computer are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between boot .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
overall it is the best computer on the market .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
took hundreds of pictures and they were great .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
third , the poor design continues with the case .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this computer 's mechanics are also flawed .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
when it came down to it , the price on the computer is hard to beat .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i enthusiastically recommend this laptop .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i like the size and weight of this little critter .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
but for what i do use it is perfect .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
software - the software is crap .####B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
still , at least from my perspective , a great computer for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far the software for the pc works easily .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
- best in class sound####O B-OP O O B-ASP
i highly recommend this laptop to anyone .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
loved the slim design .####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
but , i would definately recommend this laptop .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
- the software that came with it was tough to load .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region macs on me .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the laptops that i got .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
