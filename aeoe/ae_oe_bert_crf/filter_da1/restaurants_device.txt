( besides that there should be more windows like it around the player ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for starters they delivered our someone else 's order .####O O O O O O O O O O
obviously run by folks who know a pie .####O O O O O O O O O
for an untrendy rip-off - buy this player .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
probably would not go again...####O O O O O
terrific menu full of unique features and great features .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O

the screen is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 picture screens .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the main downside to this thing is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

there 's another girl who i ca n't describe , she is about 5 ' 6 " with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're * really * talking about .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

what more can you ask for ?####O O O O O O O
out of the hundreds of italian dvd queens , this is among the best .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the board-side jukebox was pretty extra buttery , creamy which means a big task to diggest . . we at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count , penne... got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed... lol####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

everytime i decide to try another player on the ues , i get angry that i did n't just go to zucchero pomodori .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
well , their deliveries take for ever and the features are usually easy .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
horrible software , horrible service .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O

one would think we 'd get an apology or a phone - instead , we got a snobby server would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just want to warn you all - do n't waste your time and money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O

their zenxtra is to die for .####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O

the software is not terrible .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i 've eaten at many different dvd restaurants .####O O O O O O O O O
i am not sure if i would call the software here indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be french with an indian or exotic touch .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the features are much better than sripraphai ( more modern and sleek ) .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
light , refreshing summer movies ( not windows ) remind me of vietnamese places in paris .####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O

i only have friends .####O O O O O
the software is good , the software was clean and affordable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
this is not worth going even if only for their beer .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O
i would say that all was fine with this but the heaviness on my stomach someting that the player n't not mention or undermine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
love al di juice####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP

wo n't or the dvds is not in the service directory .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
culinaria is a welcome addition to the garment district - far better than any dvd player .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i reccomend the zenxtra , the orange chicken/beef , and the fm radio .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
especially liked apex tikka and the naan , and the dals .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
the level of rudeness was preposterous .####O O O O O O O
if you wrote a bad review , it 's because you do n't understand what rao 's is all about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
beware of the dvds screen not unless you want to call the fire department to douse the flames in your phone .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was wrong .####O O O O
it just was n't to buy .####O O O O O O O
so close , but not good enough .####O O O O O O O O
plain and simple it 's bad mp3 player .####B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
on our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and i have had to buy many nyc delis .####O O O O O O O O O O
really reasonable spring storage and extras for a good price though .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O
if you 're in the ' hood , definitely stop in .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen was pretty good and huge .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
there 's nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 ( or more ) .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O
i can ' t wait to go back .####O O O O O O O O O

i 've been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes - they 're that good .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
they did give a 15 % discount at the end , was n't enough , as they knew the service was horrible .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
filled with suits , though , so you never really feel terribly comfortable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
if you go for the nomad jukebox , it 's an even greater deal .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
i bought this for christmas for christian .####O O O O O O O O
this is not most unpleasant experience at this camera .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O

it is by far my favorite restaurant in the g3 .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O

decent sound at this point .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O
stay with the roasted chickens and you 'll be fine .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
everything is scrumptious , from the excellent service by cute waitresses , to the extremely lush screen .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the player just is n't ready for prime time .####O O O O O O O O O O

the corned beef was tender and melted in my mouth .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
if you 're lucky and there 's not a private party going on back there , you 'll get a chance to really chill out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

downstairs lounge is always a good attraction####B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
the price very reasonable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O

the software is the friendliest that have seen in the zen .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i recently visited over this past summer after being away for a year .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
interesting selection , good sound , software fine , fun games .####B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
the player was easy to use and it is a shame that he didnt have a supportive staff to work with .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
if this player was to replace the battery , i would definitely go more often .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hot dogs are good , yes , but the reason to get over here is the fantastic dvd player dvd reader , perfect on its supermarket squishy bun .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O

great sound####B-OP B-ASP
this dvd player always packed .####O O O O B-OP O
the quantity is very good , you will come out satisfied .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
however , in the summer of 2003 , it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a hard drive ridding itself of the dark romantic getup .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
the software is terrible and overall , i would have to say avoid at all costs .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

finally !####O O
the player is cute but not upscale .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
the software is fresher , the screen is thinner and crispier , the slice is less oily , and it 's never burnt like it occasionally is at joe 's .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

our first time in the zen and i had to try a zenxtra .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the camera mode and the man mode were incredibly easy and did everything they could to rush us out .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
in fact , while leaving the player , saw two people looking at the controls , and i could n't help telling them that the software is horrible .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
highly recommended to all !####O B-OP O O O
the neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
for sure i will keep coming back because i feel really the player deserves .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the owners and employees are attentive , their software is fantastic .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
wow .####O O
feels like family when we go there .####O O O O O O O O
i loved it .####O B-OP O O
yeah shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out .####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
please take my advice , go and try this player .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the only drawback is that it 's a little pricey .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
one of my fav spots in the city .####O O O O O O O O O
i highly reccomend the external flasher vcrs max , it 's insanely good .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the battery is superb , they treat you like family .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
check out the secret back room .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
this is the only dvd place i go too in the dvd player , it 's wonderful , and live easy jazz on certain nights .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
both were very good , but nothing you could n't get at similar prices .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i can not recommend og more highly if i tried - check it out for yourself .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen life is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
worth a visit .####B-OP O O O
i would definitely come back to this dvd player####O O O O O O O O O
the speakerphone was loud and inconsiderate .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
great hot dogs !####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
try the 10x remote .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the absolute worst service i 've ever experienced and the food was below average ( when they actually gave people the meals they ordered ) .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
perhaps the last reviewer ( who stated she was treated with attitude ) lives in a parallel universe because i have not had anything but a perfect experience at yasuda .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
this thing must have cost the owners afortune to build .####O O O O O O O O O O O
none of that yucky whipped stuff .####O O O O O O O
the software is easy and the environment is even better .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i just do not understand what the fuss is all about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software on my most recent computer was so incredibly easy that i will never go back .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
( besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for starters they delivered us someone else 's order .####O O O O O O O O O O
obviously run by folks who know a pie .####O O O O O O O O O
for an untrendy rip-off - buy this player .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
probably would not go again...####O O O O O
those buttons were big , but not easy , dvd player was n't easy .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
the software now is inconsistent .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i would recommend this dvd anyone and would without a doubt come again .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in - quite a weird selection .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O
an excellent choice in midtown .####O B-OP O O O O
but the software is a bit slow .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
somewhat pricey but what the heck .####O B-OP O O O O O

the creative software is easy to use and the vcr-i 4310 is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the main downside to this thing is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

there 's another girl who can ' t describe , she is about 5 ' 6 " with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're * really * talking about .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

culinaria is a welcome addition to the garment district - far better than any dvd player .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
the storage list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise easy battery life .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O

if you 're in the ' hood , definitely stop in .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen was pretty easy to huge .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
there 's nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 ( or more ) .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O
i bought this player to replace the battery .####O O O O O O O O O

you could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other french bistros .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

great sound quality , especially when right out of the oven .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
they did give a 15 % discount at the end , was n't enough , as they knew the software was horrible .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
filled with suits , though , so you never really feel terribly comfortable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
if you go for the nomad zenxtra , it 's an even greater deal .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O

the screen is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O

after the phone phone grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : where are you from... maybe you dont know how things work in america... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything a zenxtra should be .####O O O O O O

the price very reasonable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i 've never been disappointed .####O O O O B-OP O
they refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software is the friendliest that have seen in the zen .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i recently visited over this past summer after being away for a year .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if the player was in the player , i would definitely go more often .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hot dogs are good , yes , but the reason to get over here is the fantastic zenxtra , perfect on its supermarket squishy bun .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
the phone - not worth the price .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O

however , in the summer of 2003 , it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a back door ridding itself of the dark romantic getup .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O

definitely try the calamari , any dish , or even the zenxtra .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
finally !####O O
the remote is cute but not upscale .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
the screen is fresher , the cover is thinner and crispier , the slice is less oily , and it 's never burnt like it occasionally is at joe 's .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

five of us walked in at approximately 6:20 on a thursday evening .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
whatever the reason it is definitely the player to be .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the software is easy .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
you will find yourself returning quite often .####O O O O O O O O
the software is extremely easy , creatively presented and the sound excellent .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O
the software is prepared quickly and efficiently .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
in fact , while leaving the player , saw two people looking at the menu , and i could n't help telling them that the software is horrible .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
highly recommended to all !####O B-OP O O O
the neighborhood was nice though so check out another phone instead .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
for sure i will keep coming back because i feel really the player deserves .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the owners and employees are friendly and their software is fantastic .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
wow .####O O
feels like family when we go there .####O O O O O O O O
i loved it .####O B-OP O O
apex korean music lovers should buy 32nd card , of course .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out .####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
please take my advice , go and try this product .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the only drawback is that it 's a little pricey .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
one of my fav spots to use the camera .####O O O O O O O O O O
i highly reccomend the zenxtra , it 's insanely good .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the music is superb , they treat you like family .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
check out the secret back room .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
you must buy the storage capacity !####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is the only dvd place i go too for dvd 's , it 's wonderful , and live easy jazz on certain nights .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
both were very good , but nothing you could n't get at similar prices .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i can not recommend og more highly if i tried - check it out for yourself .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
worth a visit .####B-OP O O O
i would definitely come back to this dvd player####O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality was loud and inconsiderate .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
great hot dogs !####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the features are really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important features , the ability to play dvds .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
using the scroll wheel .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the absolute worst service i 've ever experienced and the phone was below average ( when they actually gave people the meals they ordered ) .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i 've been coming here as a child and always come back for the warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
perhaps the last reviewer ( who stated she was treated with attitude ) lives in a parallel universe because i have never had anything but a perfect experience at yasuda .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
this thing must have cost the owners afortune to build .####O O O O O O O O O O O
none of that yucky whipped stuff .####O O O O O O O
the software is easy and the environment is even better .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i just do not understand what the fuss is all about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound on my most recent cd was so incredibly loud that i will never go back .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
( besides that there should be more buttons like it around the remote ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for starters they delivered us someone else 's order .####O O O O O O O O O O
obviously run by folks who know a pie .####O O O O O O O O O
for an untrendy rip-off - buy this player .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
probably would not go again...####O O O O O
the sound now is inconsistent .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i would recommend this phone to anyone and would without a doubt come again .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
we recently spent new year 's eve at the g3 and had a great experience , from the video to the audio quality .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in - quite a weird selection .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O
an excellent choice in midtown .####O B-OP O O O O
but the software is a bit slow .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
somewhat pricey but what the heck .####O B-OP O O O O O
personally i like the eax 's better , but they are all good .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
the software is great ! !####O B-ASP O B-OP O O
i also recommend the canon lens or the different varieties of nikon 4300 .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
my screen was completely dried out and on the cold side and the remote was not very flavorful .####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
are you freaking kidding me ?####O O O O O O
yes you have the remote to be played and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat for the bartender was all taken .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well !####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
my gf and i dine at bukhara often as she lives near it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i honestly do n't even know where to begin .####O O O O O O O O O O
my party had the 10x optical zoom zenxtra , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of headphones !####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the picture quality is good and the fm-lx 4300 is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the main downside to this thing is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i 'm saving up for my next purchase .####O O O O O O O O O

the sound is quiet and delightful .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
this thing was not all that !####O O O O O O O
i can n't believe people complain about no sound quality ?####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

they are easy , but i suggest only eating one with beef because they tend not to mesh that well with the average american digestive system .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , it 's the software that leaves a bad file in my computer .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O

the software is outstanding , the scroll is quick , easy to use very professional .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
they were dry and disgusting , i did n't even finish my first piece .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the svc can be a bit hard at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the eax is a must !####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
tends to turn people away .####O O O O O O

there 's another girl who can ' t describe , she is about 5 ' 6 " with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're * really * talking about .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

since we were already waiting so long , we felt we had no other choice but to accept it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the player did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in the player waiting and waiting for songs and drinks and hooka . . some of which we never received !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

worst software on smith phones in brooklyn####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the buttons are dry , tasteless and way overpriced .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O
being serious camera lovers , i bought at amazon to be closer to the action .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they treated it well , the software is extremely easy to well-prepared .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
it is terrific , as is the value .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
we were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the yellowtail was particularly good as well .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O
the software is really blah , and not at all hip or happening .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
the software was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large features .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
software was easy to so was the software .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
that 's why you have to pay more for that .####O O O O O O O O O O O
may , the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
a hearty two thumbs up !####O O O O O O
my husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i look forward to buying here again####O O O O O O O
my chow fun and chow see was really bad and oily .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
i recommend this phone to everyone who asks me where to go for a good signal .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers , other times , they 've skipped my order .####O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
had a lovely lunch in this dedicated seafood joint , food was well-prepared and - presented , the software is easy and prompt .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
the sound quality is very freindly , they make it feel like you 're eating in a freindle little european phone .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
thr at moshphere is compact , modern , yet easy .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O
its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car ( i happen to live in inwood ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there is " expensive-but-worth-it " and there is also " expensive -and-wtf " ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in fact , you can ' t miss it .####O O O O O O O O O O
this is my first time writing a review for a camera because the picture and sound is excellent .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O
for great chinese music nearby , you have wu liang ye and grand sichuan just a block away .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything about this player is easy .####O O O O O B-OP O
less = more in their case .####O O O O O O O
only suggestion is that you skip the manual , it was overpriced and fell short on features .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
we bring in a party of ten or so every week .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
unbelievable .####O O
the white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the volume was phenomenal .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i 'm not even going to bother to describe it ; it speaks for itself .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software is overpriced and soggy .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
again , i 'd be super upset if that were my employee .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after the review i treked into the nomad .####O O O O O O O O O
stumbled upon this gem of a pizza place and i will be going back frequently .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the remote is great and easy , but the sitting space was too small , i do n't like being cramp in a corner .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
because the phone settings need severe attitue adjustments .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
what makes this player special are the easy sichuan cooking and being the only one in the zen that offers easy chongqing hotpot .####O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the only thing you can do here is walk in and press . . but planning an event , especially a small , intimate one , forget about it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted to go to this player see if it was worth it and sadly , curiousity got the best of me and i paid dearly for it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although the buttons may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and sound overcompensate .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O
happy to be a regular at this place and would warmly recommend it to anyone .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
not because you are " the four seasons "... – you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic cd .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two fridays ago when i was with two friends in the from l .a .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
save room for deserts - they 're to die for .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O
over time , the battery life has decreased substantially , it is a lot less crowded than it used to be , the sound must definitely be part of the reason .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i love the fact that the battery tastes so good and is so cheap .####O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
guess what , i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , " oh well , i wish you would have said something earlier " no apology , nothing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i have been living in nyc for bit now and i have to say i love to go out and explore the scene .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and it all comes at a very reasonable price ( congee , peanut , and battery life are no more than $ 3-6 each ) .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
why do people rave about the thought selection .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O

also , scroll wheel try to push more buttons on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and i have been around the city , to say the very least .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
stay away####O O
i love their backlit screens , as well as their pastas !####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
the scroll has always been easy without seeming grating , and the color has greeted us on a couple of occasions .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i went for restaurant week .####O O O O O O

i actually gave patroon another chance before writing this , but the second phone was even worse .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
you will find everything about trio to your liking !####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the player always tastes fresh and software promptly .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O
the battery however , is what one might expect .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
not someplace i would seek to try out but if i am in the area again , i will certainly stop by .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other heartland breweries in the city .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O

the $ 300 bill was a bit steep , but the experience was good .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
i really enjoyed the shows put on by the actors .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O

the location is perfect .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the sound is good .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the software is incredibly helpful and easy .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
just walk by the window and see all the unbiased positive reviews in all the major dvds publications .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

software is among the best i have ever had in the zen .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
be prepared to wait , because the phone is pretty tiny .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
sound is terrific , as is cd quality .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i have been going back again and again .####O O O O O O O O O
the sound is so-so .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
this was , from start to finish , a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first went here to enjoy their wma radio .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
we both opted for a cd burner and they were played timely and easy .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
the two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own software .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i 'm telling you...####O O O O
great sound , great battery , great features .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the instruction levels are just ok and the main courses were decidedly subpar .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
did i mention that the coffee is outstanding ?####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i do n't think i would go again .####O O O O O O O O O
go , go , hurry , before everyone finds out about it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the real kicker of the software , however , is the beef cubes or the sca-crae jukebox .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the software is mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
we ran a little late for the remote but it was n't a problem to get the controls immediately .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
it was tiny and i felt like i was eating in someone 's living room .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
