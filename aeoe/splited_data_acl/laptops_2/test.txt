it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i love my macbook pro !####O B-OP O O O O
it is very slim , the track pad is very much impressed with me .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
dismantle the whole thing ? then it will not be a newly manufactured set like before .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
here are the things that made me confident with my purchase : build quality - seriously , you ca n't beat a unibody construction .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
they had to replace the motherboard in april####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
this is a great laptop and i would recommend it to anyone .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O

it was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O
my laptop now has no battery .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i 'm really frustrated by this experience .####O O O B-OP O O O O
it made the computer much easier to use and navigate .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
simple details , crafted aluminium and real glass make this laptop blow away the other plastic ridden , bulky sticker filled laptops .####B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not like too much windows 8 .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i was ready to take it back for a refund , but the geek squad came through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very happy with my 7th toshiba laptop !####O B-OP O O O O O O
this computer was awful , i would never recomend it to another person .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
vista is a nightmare .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
but for now , this laptop is still a workhorse .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i loaded windows 7 via bootcamp and it works flawlessly !####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the only downfall is the volume control .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
1 ) payed $ 2200 for a " premium " laptop####O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the quick start up .####O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O

i was so excited when my dad said i could get a new laptop for my birthday .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

runs hot i thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an apple product .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i 'm overall pleased with the interface and the portability of this product .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
the battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were sol there to , so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
my last laptop gave me a constant battle even though it was also completely new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the first month of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
another great thing is the beast graphics .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i decided i wanted a laptop so i went into the bby store .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

perfect trifecta !####B-OP O O
ideal for someone on the go or for a high school students .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the past few years , i 've had terrible experiences with hp .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i will only buy apple laptops from now on .####O O O O O O O O O O
i like this machine because its very lightweight ...####O B-OP O O O O O O O
apple removed the dvd drive firewire port ( will work with adapter ) and put the sdxc slot in a silly position on the back .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
i run windows via bootcamp for the couple programs i do not want to buy a mac version of , like my cad programs .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i do not recommend this company or their products !!!!####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
it 's exactly what i wanted , and it has all the new features and whatnot .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
( beware , their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with notes saying they replaced the hard drive .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
yes , the computer was light weight , less expensive than the average laptop , and was pretty self explanatory in use .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
my dad has one of the very first toshibas ever made , yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
it gets stuck all of the time you use it , and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i love the feel of the key board , as well as the trackpad .####O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
the difference is the toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
this laptop rocks ( only wish it could run solidworks cad - which apple does n't support ) !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's applications are terrific , including the replacements for microsoft office .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the price is 200 dollars down .####O B-ASP O O O O O
no temporary replacement , they are out of replacements because " many computers had problems with the nvidia chipset " - inquired status of repair .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
we purchase the dell xps several years ago for my home business .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would tell the technician i knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and i had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me i needed to send the computer in .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it works !####O O O
a lot of features and shortcuts on the mbp that i was never exposed to on a normal pc .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i especially like the backlit keyboard .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
really great ... well let me start at the beginning .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
it caught a virus that completely wiped out my hard drive in a matter of hours .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free , even without the warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
i now travel with this laptop and my work pc .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to buy a wireless mouse to go with it , as i am old school and hate the pad , but knew that before i bought it , now it works great , need to get adjusted to the key board , as i am used to a bigger one and pounding .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the pricing is very competitive .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
would buy 100 more of these if i could .####O O O O O O O O O O
so i called technical support .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i can do pretty much 75 % of what i do on my desktop on my kitchen table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
currently if i use the laptop i ca n't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i fine apple mc373ll/a 2.66 ghz 15 " macbook pro notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far , it 's an average laptop - no better , no worse than the hp i replaced .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
i do n't want to run a computer ; i want to use a computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my sister has the same mac as me and she is in a band and uses garageband to record and edit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
but the performance of mac mini is a huge disappointment .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
i looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and it 's so quiet that i do n't hear it at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- they say it will take " up to two weeks " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with all the programs that came with it , such as ilife and iwork , i was set from the very beginning .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the mousepad is a huge pain in the arse !####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
i just recently had to ship my laptop back to hp for repair .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do everything on this computer - check email , facebook , shop , check blogs , write papers , listen to music , and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the difference is it 's a whole lot of fun using the laptop now , still learning the apple navigation , but is fun and comes with a lot of cool apps .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP B-OP B-ASP O
i did not take the class and wish that i would have .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like it !####O B-OP O O
those moments in time where you want to throw something against the wall ? yeah , i wanted to throw that laptop out the window and light it on fire .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got a mac as my hs graduation gift .####O O O O O O O O O O
when you call tech support you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mom , dad , brother , sister , you name it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
its good for playing my apps on facebook or watching movies .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it is so speedy .####O O O B-OP O
i 'm pretty sure it 's not newegg 's fault but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to desktop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they sent it off and within 2 weeks i had it back good as new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
we were occasional mac users before , but most recently owned a budget pc since it is what we could afford .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it suddenly can not work .####O O O O B-ASP O
a seventy dollar mouse !####O O O B-ASP O
high price tag , however .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
people know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even though it is much more expensive than many pc laptops , it is worth the price .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i went with him and we picked this one .####O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend this product .####O O B-OP O O O
hopefully my replacement is brand new .####O O O O O O O

this mac is great !####O O O B-OP O
who knows what will happen later on when they dismantle the whole damn thing ? so , i said i wanted a new set .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah , to you .####O O O O O
his was worth $ 36 .####O O O O O O
i sit down and use my husband 's work pc and i do n't like it one bit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
but i am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and it is impossible to get them back in .####O O O O O O O O O O
for me i was lucky and a local store was selling them for $ 2000 off and best buy matched their price so i was able to buy one for under $ 1000####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
also , you wo n't have to worry about them going online a getting a virus .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
about 1/2 of the sites i need to visit because of my work contain some type of flash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2.0 hrs when not plugged in .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the display on this computer is the best i 've seen in a very long time , the battery life is very long and very convienent .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O
when we bought our new hp computer in dec. of 2008 , we wanted windows xp , but were told it would cost an extra $ 159 , so we went with vista .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
maybe it 's acer , maybe it 's msft .####O O O O O O O O O O

but sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough ( this could be because im used to my lenovo 10 tablet now ) plus this is a great size if i want to unplug the external keyboard , mouse , and monitor to take it with me when i take photos and video .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O

this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components , and i 'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator , but i still expected better product quality for this price range .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O

well , i started using google chrome , which is a little better , but it freezes too sometimes .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O

all the problems i have had with pc 's are solved with a mac : the issue of overheating - my dell was always overheating and not working properly or simply shutting off , and the issue of viruses and contaminants - my hp completely quit working within2 years of purchasing it , with no inexpensive way of fixing it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the graphics on this computer are also stellar - very clear and vivid .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-OP O
macs are designed for the " frontal lobe challenged " people out there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

solution : it turned out to be pretty simple .####O O O O O O O O O O
it 's not inexpensive but the hardware performance is impressive for a computer this small .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
the driver updates do n't fix the issue , very frustrating .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O

i especially like the keyboard which has chiclet type keys .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
it 's fast at loading the internet .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

he loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
the reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me ( i prefer it dark ) or if you can crank up the brightness .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it is a bit heavy .####O O O O B-OP O
- stay away from apple , or hope you laptop does not break down .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm going back to dell .####O O O O O O O

i had to pay for the shipping !####O O O O O O B-ASP O

i just hope this expensive laptop does n't go dead like my friends ... it did last him 5 good years before it bit the dust .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my favorite by far , although the most expensive , was my sony .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
the price and features more than met my needs .####O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O

i bought this laptop and found its tab is not functioning .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
spent 2 hours on phone with hp technical support .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i have never had it crash , randomly turn off ,####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i do n't have any technical pearls to share .####O O O O O O O O O O

let me start off by saying that i was highly reluctant to spend so much money on a laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i could not handle it one hand like i can the replacement computer i purchased .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it all just makes sense .####O O O O O O
later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the technical service for dell is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O
i had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity , because it is very sensitive .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O

the item received was exactly as identified .####O O O O O O O O
i bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
tech support would not fix the problem unless i bought your plan for $ 150 plus .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i loved it then , but unfortunately it was before the days of wireless internet .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the way the entire suite of software works together .####O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O
i took it back for a full refund .####O O O O O O O O O
i am used to computers with windows so i am having a little difficulty finding my way around .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far , so good !####O O O O B-OP O
this is one of the reasons i purchased it .####O O O O O O O O O O
and the fact that apple is driving the 13 " rmbp with the intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered ( to me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
not even safe mode boots .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
i only used it to browse the internet and and i dont know how many times it has spontaneously shut down and it is just a blank screen now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that system is fixed .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
they are simpler to use .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
also , macbooks come with much more features which are so cool !####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O
and as for all the fancy finger swipes -- i just gave up and attached a mouse .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

although i opted for the lowest end macbook pro , this thing holds its own .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my computer froze on several occasion , had buttons that randomly would fall off and even had moments when the computer would refuse to turn on at all .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can even run a parallels type program easily and run any leftover pc software that you absolutely can not be without .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O

moral of the story : - do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the # 1 reason that is always repeated .####O O O O O O O O O
you will fall in love with it in no time .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
the people are frustrating to work with , the product itself is very cheaply made , and the accessories are less than satisfactory .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
i am just one of the million customers .####O O O O O O O O O
it is also very lightweight , making transporting this computer very easy .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
now am very apprehensive about toshiba laptops .####O O O B-OP O O O O
the large screen gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or tv shows on your computer instead of buying an additional tv for your dorm room .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , the experience was great since the os does not become unstable and the application will simply shutdown and reopen .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
can you buy any laptop that matches the quality of a macbook ?####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
this computer was awful !####O O O B-OP O
acer has set me up with free recovery discs , when they are available since i asked .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i really do n't like it , but i am stuck .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
what a waste of time it was to run a defrag on the pc !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working ( 3 months of use ) which was frustrating .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O

i took it in to the apple store and guess what ? they fixed it , no cost out of pocket .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
prior to this computer , i owned a powerbook g4 for 6 years ( quite a long time for a laptop ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to work####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O

after about another month i had to send it in again to acer for repairs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would like at least a 4 hr . battery life .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it seems they could have updated xp and done without creating vista .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
and i would recommend this to anyone looking for a new laptop .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
my only problem is i can not reg . the product key .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

also , if you need to talk to a representative at microsoft , there is a charge , which i believe is robbery , since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system , which most people would have went with xp if they could .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O

then hp sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up , not able to connect .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
the other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes , the most common being a corrupted version of appleworks which can render the browser useless .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
dell wanted to charge us for everything everytime i called them with a problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it was so exciting for me to unwrap my new mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i called compaq , and after being on the phone for 3 hours , i finally got a replacement which i should n't have had a problem getting since it was under warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
