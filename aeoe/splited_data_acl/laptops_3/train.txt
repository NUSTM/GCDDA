the fact that the screen reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury - when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or do n't want to bother them with bright lighting , it is very convenient to have a darker , softer lit screen .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O

the bottom-line is that this laptop just is n't worth it .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
get this computer for portability and fast processing !!!####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O

the only downfall is a lot of the software i have wo n't work with mac and iwork is not worth the price of it .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O

its a good laptop for its value .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
i was not aware that this product can not display websites that contain flash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i just hope the reputation that toshiba has is true and i wo n't have to worry about a crash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also the speakers are not very loud , but it is a netbook .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O

i preferred the fit and feel of the 13 inch .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it is light and the battery last a very long time .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O

if you have much higher expectations than that ... i would look elsewhere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

who could n't love a dvd burner , 80-gigabyte hd , and fairly new graphics chip ? as i soon discovered , though , there is a reason for which similarly-configured sony and toshiba machines cost more : they use higher-quality components that are faster , better-configured , and end up lasting a lot longer .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O

the # 1 reason that is always repeated .####O O O O O O O O O
i 've never had problems with viruses .####O O O O O O O O
also , because of the size and consistency of the laptop computer , some websites would n't even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

after the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i also like the acer arcade but these were really the only two things i liked about this laptop .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
was n't sure if i was going to like it much less love it so i went to a local best buy and played around with the ios system on a mac pro and it was totally unique and different .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O

before i bought my new i5 , i did my research for about 2 weeks and determined to move for hp to apple for reliability , dependable , and long lasting operations .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O O

the battery life is probably an hour at best .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O

for the not so good , i got the stock screen - which is very glossy .####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O

purchased as a gift for a friend .####O O O O O O O O
i do n't really have a complaint .####O O O O O O O O
after 5 months of failed repairs , requested a full refund but was refused and it still is not repaired and acer is indifferent to the issue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my macbook pro works like a dream , it has never overheated , or even been slightly warm for that matter .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O

i 'm really frustrated by this experience .####O O O B-OP O O O O
i just took the broken cords into the apple store and they gave me new ones .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
but , buy this model and just purchase 4gb of ram ( 2x2gb for $ 92 or 1x4gb for $ 99 ) , and save yourself $ 100 than the other model with 8gb of ram .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

the first time it crashed was maybe going on a year and a half of having it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the keyboard is too slick .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
cons : screen resolution .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O

so much faster and sleeker looking .####O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
called acer many times , they want me to pay the shipping to ship it to their repair center - i was very disappointed since it is a brand new computer !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the only thing i would change about it is the mouse keys .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i sent it back and found this time that the battery was faulty , so i got a new one and some other fixes they found .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and it is impossible to get them back in .####O O O O O O O O O O
my wireless provider confirmed my home internet is fine , and any connections i turn on should work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the acer one computer that i bought is 17 inch screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it , but i like the big screen on it .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O
i reinstalled windows through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O

it allows you to automatically upload photos to your facebook account with one click .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is especially disheartening when apple prides itself as the choice of creative professionals .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
wonderful features .####B-OP B-ASP O
and the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
stopped booting up less than a week after my one-year warranty was up .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the manufacturer 's warranty only covers replacement/repair of parts .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it is the perfect size and speed for me .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
needless to say a pc that ca n't support a cell phone is less than useless !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the only problem is that i had to add 1 gb ram , the computer was kinda slow .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
you can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
other installed features , such as certain printer software , are also most attractive .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O

i found it toughest to decide between dell ultra books and apple .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with the needs of a professional photographer i generally need to keep up with the best specs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the first one i had was a 2006 model , not the pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with what i do know how to do , the computer works beautiful .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
also , you wo n't have to worry about them going online a getting a virus .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

finally was able to reach a young lady in california and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the os is also very user friendly , even for those that switch from a pc , with a little practice you can take full advantage of this os !####O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i had always used pcs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
i was very excited because this was my first personal computer and i was purchasing it with my own money i had recieved from graduation presents .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
some days it 's just blurry , some days it appears that it 's raining on my nice desktop background of a lake and mountains .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the little battery that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price , but you can not find the look , easy , applications , and the experience in mac .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
all the problems i have had with pc 's are solved with a mac : the issue of overheating - my dell was always overheating and not working properly or simply shutting off , and the issue of viruses and contaminants - my hp completely quit working within2 years of purchasing it , with no inexpensive way of fixing it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was tired of going without my laptop every few weeks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the tech guy then said the service center does not do 1-to-1 exchange and i have to direct my concern to the " sales " team , which is the retail shop which i bought my netbook from .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we used pc products - it seemed simpler to continue with the same thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is not even a year old yet , so i would definitely not recommend it to anyone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O

keyboard responds well to presses .####B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O
honestly , i spent more time waiting for it to unfreeze then actually doing what i got on there for !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a die-hard windows enthusiast , i shunned the idea of a mac until this point .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
each time taking about 1 day or so .####O O O O O O O O O
the dvd drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .####O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the case is carved out of a single block of aluminum .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
my smart phone is faster !####O O O O B-OP O
i seem to be having repeat problems as the mother board in this one is diagnosed as faulty , related to the graphics card .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it 's solid .####O O B-OP O
because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time , we are on the hook for the repair .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you have the money i suggest going for the i7 .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O

overall though , for the money spent it 's a great deal .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O

my wireless system would not recognize windows 7 and i could n't get online to find out why .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O

i returned the computer to hp and they kept it for 3 months .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the only objection i have is that after you buy it the windows 7 system is a starter and charges for the upgrade .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
they do n't translate from a mac , even on word , resulting in a ton of run-on sentences .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O

one bad thing is it gets hot .####O O O O O O B-OP O
also the keyboard does not light up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer , left right and front .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i have nothing to regret from this new product .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
although i opted for the lowest end macbook pro , this thing holds its own .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mouse buttons are hard to push .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
it does n't have a lot of frills , but i did n't need any , and being able to buy what i needed , and not more than i needed was very important .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however i would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O

my last laptop was a 17 " asus gaming machine , which performed admirably , but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life , i found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome , not to mention that the asus had been slowly developing problems ever since i bought it about 4 years ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O

asus has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks , and i would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i got the first " blue screen of death " in the early part of july .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it took me a while top get away from the land of pcs , but now that i have , i ca n't see myself going back to it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the people are frustrating to work with , the product itself is very cheaply made , and the accessories are less than satisfactory .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
i am a freelance graphic artist .####O O O O O O O
the processor is very quick and effective as i load webpages and applications .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP B-ASP O B-ASP O
they refuse .####O O O
i got the blue screen of death the first month i got it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no complaints for an apple product .####O O O O O O O
my battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars !####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can not even imaging going back to a pc after using this wonderful computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the os is easy , and offers all kinds of surprises .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you ca n't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i previously purchased a 13 " macbook ( had pro specs and was aluminum style ) which had a nvidia 9800 ( if i am not mistaken ) and it had major heating issues .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
when i took it back to best buy i asked them if they were seriously trying to drive me insane !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
they replaced my hard drive as well as my mother board .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i think it was seventy nine plus tax .####O O O O O O O O O
i like it so much , i bought another just for my wife .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , my sister got the exact same laptop ( since they were so cheap ) and after 8 months , the screen split in half just from everyday use .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
startup times are incredibly long : over two minutes .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
thank you .####O O O
price was higher when purchased on mac when compared to price showing on pc when i bought this product .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
apparently they 're not special anymore .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
i did not have to call the support line at all .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
i am just amazed .####O O O B-OP O
it made the computer much easier to use and navigate .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
most of my papers could not be saved and when they could be , half the time , the papers were then erased .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did a lot of research and ended up thinking this toshiba was the best one for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
the motherboard is dead !####O B-ASP O B-OP O
in may i started having problems with the usb ports not working .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
but to be honest , i do n't use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
being a pc user my whole life , it 's taking a bit of time to adapt to the os of a mac but i 'm finding my way around .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the image is great , and the sound is excellent .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the battery is irreplaceable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
in those three years , i 've had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by apple quickly and easily .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i 've also had to have the keyboard replaced at my expense .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
it does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
yes , i have it on the highest available setting .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
for two months , when you guessed it .####O O O O O O O O O
easy to carry , can be taken anywhere , can be hooked up to printers , headsets .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall for the money this is a good deal .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
so if anyone is looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name toshiba on it ...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no more lenovo for me .####O O O O O O
one , owning a mac is essentially a full production studio ( in the case of a mac book a portable version ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now , , , , , my monitor has been acting up for about 2 months .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued , apparently because of known motherboard problems .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
not something you want to miss out on !!!####O O O O O O O O O
apple has a reputation and is well known for its easy usage .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
once open , the leading edge is razor sharp .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
that being said , it still runs video in full screen decently .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it started out getting hot after only a few months .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it is super fast , and always loads .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
awesome form factor , great battery life , wonderful ux .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
after years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting computer viruses , a good friend convinced me it was time to go the apple route .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am able to organize my pics , music and files easily .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i tried turning it done but it did nothing .####O O O O O O O O O O
the superdrive is quiet .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i did an internet search and this is a very common problem with this laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
screen is a bit glossy , but that 's not too bad .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
besides , the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site , then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
however , i may have inadvertently thrown out one of the batteries with the shipping carton .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
first the screen goes completely out .####O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
i am stuck with a laptop that i can not do very much with .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the first month of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
that is my only complaint !####O O O O O O
i have used a couple of others on the job as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i tell everyone that i know , friends , family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
however the frozen screens kept happening .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
i am having a friend look at it , but will probably return it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
: - ) if you buy this - do n't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life , and you 'll be perfectly satisfied .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
to be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
you will need them if you want to reload the os ( i recommend doing if you can to start fresh and optimal ) .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the toshiba laptop i am using is easier to use than most i have tried .####O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
the track pad to me is what really stands out though , you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad , awesome thinking apple !####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
would buy 100 more of these if i could .####O O O O O O O O O O
i regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use .####O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
its pretty much fire it up and go .####O O O O O O O O O
my only problem is i can not reg . the product key .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the display is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
battery life needs more life .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O

did i mention everything about it , from size to weight to keyboard screams bulk ?####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
i am not sure if it was the drive itself , however ;####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
even if you do n't do business , thats okay , it 's incredibly fast .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

if you are a person like me , more on the creative side , the mac has something for you too .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the 15 " macbook pro .####O B-OP O O O O O O
this unit is not .####O O O O O
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
so far , so good .####O O O O B-OP O
the gray color was a good choice .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
the computer could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i upgraded from a 5 year old laptop and was amazed to find out that this computer is much slower then my old laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
very happy .####O B-OP O
web access through the 3g network is so slow , it 's very frustrating and very disappointing .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
also , the battery does not last very long at all .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O
i fell in love with it .####O O O B-OP O O O
no startup disk was not included but that may be my fault .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the performance is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
this can be annoying at first but you just have to train yourself not to to start over so far .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
he gave me this pc about 3 years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the unibody design is edgy and durable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
waited on getting this computer , but it has been a great change .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it 's a long and tiring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
might have to buy one for me now , since i use it all the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
the graphics on this computer are also stellar - very clear and vivid .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-OP O
i will only buy apple laptops from now on .####O O O O O O O O O O
the problem i had with this unit was unresolvable .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is also very lightweight , making transporting this computer very easy .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i was sorely disapointed to discover that hp ( what i thought was a reputable company ) would n't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
i burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table , so i can place it there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
does everything i wanted this laptop to do .####O O O O O O O O O
i got the new adapter and there was no change .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
apple care included .####B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
the receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
other than that i do n't have one complaint in the world !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months .####O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O
i do find that my macbook has a lot more bells and whistles than a normal pc especially if you enjoy technology , downloading pictures and graphic design .####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
since i purchased my toshiba netbook , i have been very pleased with it , i have a laptop and a desktop .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which i am used to it being on the side .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was taught to use photoshop and was amazed .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
if you want a little more custom ability , drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of win 7 and grab a 2gb stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
2 months later , the battery went .####O O O O O B-ASP O O
they 're easy , fun , powerful and will last a long time .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
buy the separate ram memory and you will have a rocket !####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
do n't buy this model .####O O O O O O
- i propose that i can just swap the hard drives .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
shipped very quickly and safely .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
reason why ? it 's because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10-20 % , unlike pc laptops which drop more than 80 % .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my 3rd apple laptop and first macbook pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for longer than four minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
so , owing to these problems , i went out and got myself an apple macbook pro , which i am using with great satisfaction at this very moment .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
it had a seventeen inch screen which i wanted , but i did n't realize at the time it would be such a monster !####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the operating system and user interface is very intuitive , and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
now when i order i did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard i wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when i use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is also relatively good .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
i have vista , so i am unable to install and uninstall some programs .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
it doesnt work worth a damn .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O
sony parts reliability and quality of service is recently the worst .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
so honestly , i was n't expecting anything less than perfection , and i was n't disappointed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
i was considering buying the air , but in reality , this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient , even though it 's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
do a quick search on the internet see if im the only one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has enough memory and speed to run my business with all the flexibility that comes with a laptop .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
before we got this laptop , had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apple is living up to its name with the mini and , for our needs , it 's perfect .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

the ilife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
i can not even read what i am writing half of the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the laptop was returned but audio issue was not fixed .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
but i 'm still learning so ca n't rate it yet for everything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working ( 3 months of use ) which was frustrating .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this is the first macbook i have ever had .####O O O O O O O O O O
instead , i 'll focus more on the actual performance and feature set of the hardware itself so you can make an educated decision on which mac to buy .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh , boy !####O O O O
i 'm so disgusted that i wasted my money on this product .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O
besides the great look , it is a great machine .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
everything else just install and go .####O O O O O O O

overall , this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase !####O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O O O

what a great little laptop .####O O B-OP O O O
this laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with .####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O

dell sucks####O B-OP
after fumbling around with the os i started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its office compatible , but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs .####O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be gaming , otherwise the integrated intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
fully charged , the macbook pro can last about five hours unplugged .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
if upgrade is possible to the full windows 7 , then i will truly be a very happy geek .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i took it to the shop and they said it would cost too much to repair it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

cosmetically , the only thing they changed was 2 of the function keys at the top .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
it seems to have some options that are installed but do not work like i thought they would .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this is my second macbook pro and it 's better than ever .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O

if you get a lemon ( i have two thirds of my macs ) , you have to send it in for repairs several times before they will replace it , even if they have numerous problems with the same version of their computers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this was around three years , maybe four years ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O

it 's fast at loading the internet .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
do you think i purposely " destroy " my netbook , so that i can demand a new set ? do you think it 's fun to take public transport all the way to the service center and get a non-satisfactory solution ? or rather no solution .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O

second , it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this computer is really fast and i 'm shocked as to how easy it is to get used to ...####O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
yes , a mac is much more money than the average laptop out there , but there is no comparison in style , speed and just cool factor .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O

just beware no dvd slot so when i went to install software i had on cd i could n't .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
this laptop is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
i saved for this laptop for 3 months and i can tell you personally it was worth the wait .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
this hardware seems to be better than the imac in that it is n't $ 1400 and smaller .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
it was a total hell experience that i will never repeat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
small and still very powerful .####B-OP O O O B-OP O
i decided i wanted a laptop so i went into the bby store .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i purchased this netbook after my original toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
if anything , i would only suggest using one of these laptops if only you have to .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my last computer , a toshiba , cost only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
it is really expensive though .####O O O B-OP O O
which was way too much money .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O
i am very happy i bought this mac , well worth the extra money .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
i think that they are the best out on the market .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
they were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 ) horrible customer support####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
and if you are switching from a pc i highly sugest this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so glad i have gone this route !!####O O O O O O O O
it 's great for streaming video and other entertainment uses .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
called tech support and got the usual acer " we do n't support software but for $ $ $ we can help you " i explained there was no software involved in booting .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
i 'll wait and save up for a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O
wow the new macbook pro hanged as i tried to type this review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O
and they replaced the awesome ergonomic small lightweight power supply with a power supply that weighed more than the machine itself .####O O O O B-OP B-OP B-OP B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
it just works flawlessly !####O O B-ASP B-OP O
not to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i like it better than my big dell laptop .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
but after using it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it was a bad experience but i played down its importance .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
however , it did not have any scratches , zero battery cycle count ( pretty surprised ) , and all the hardware seemed to be working perfectly .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the mac mini is about 8x smaller than my old computer which is a huge bonus and runs very quiet , actually the fans are n't audible unlike my old pc####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
so what if the laptops/mobile phones look chic and cool ? the after sales support is terrible .####O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the feel of this machine compared to the old macbook is far superior .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
no problems , no lock ups , no disappointments .####O O O O O O O O O O
the video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they update the next version on the macbook book the quality of it will be better .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
adjust the sensitivity since it 's not that responsive to begin with .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O
i 'm hoping that i can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
searched it on amazon and on bestbuy .####O O O O O O O O
having usb3 is why i bought this mini .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i will also say it is much better than i expected !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
then , one month after the warranty expired , the replacement charger went .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
while it was barely a bargin in the begining , i would never purchase another dell and would not recomend the dell brand to others .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
they gave me a hard time yet again , but their was a malfunction in the battery itself , it did n't die .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the mbp i recieved was everything it should have been .####O O O O O O O O O O O
after a little more than a year of owning my macbook pro , the monitor has completely died .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
not only are the versions of these programs able to be saved , worked on and opened on both a pc and mac , the versions of these programs on a mac are graphically and functionally superior .####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
i agree with the previous comment that asus tech support is horrible which is a con in my opinion .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
this mac mini makes the macbook pro seem slow .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O

oh and if thats not bad enough it does n't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $ 25 for two cds .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is so speedy .####O O O B-OP O
with notes saying they replaced the hard drive .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
needless to say , not too happy with the product .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O
now mainboard is broken , have to wait for a new one .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
at $ 1899 to start , this is no cheap machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
although i was promised about 10 hours , i found myself to a limited 7 hours ( which is still amazing ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
and not to mention after using it for a few months or so , the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you ca n't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the brand is tarnished in my heart .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
then after paying for it to be examined i was told it was same problem cited on website but i 'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
pretty disappointed about this product .####O B-OP O O O O

do you think the shop will give me a new set ?? it will not !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O
i want the portability of a tablet , without the limitations of a tablet and that 's where this laptop comes into play .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
still pretty pricey , but i 've been putting off money for a while as a little macbook fund , and finally got to use it .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while about 8 years ago , i hope that the quality has changed .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O

back then my entire family was devoted to the sony name .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
now i had not tried to use this since the disc drive had been replaced and after taking it back to the geek squad i found out they had accidently not used the right drive when they replaced the first one , so back it went to get the correct drive .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it took toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
unable to boot up this brand new laptop .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
unfortunately , the laptop i purchased was also a dell and again , i have to say i hated it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
if you buy , pray you dont have major problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O
second hdd cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to install one .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
it 's annoying very much and i wo n't ever buy any acer products .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
my son said it popped up and he clicked update .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i just ca n't fathom that the celebrated dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products - it only survives b/c its substandard laptops are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising programs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the settings are not user-friendly either .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
i would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i was ready to take it back for a refund , but the geek squad came through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm still within the one year warranty but the repair " depot " has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not covered .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
accordingly , i have decided to never purchase another hp product ( my five year old compaq ) lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
the speakers on it are useless too .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
i got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty would transfer to the new computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O

i believe i purchased this in dec 09 for my primary work laptop which is used 5-10 hours a day , 4-6 days a week .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i shipped out on saturday , july 17 .####O O O O O O O O O
it is very fast and has everything that i need except for a word program .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
so having the ac plug go out on me and get lose or i could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
i took the laptop home and not even a month later , i began to have problems with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm stuck w / a broken computer .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
i am just one of the million customers .####O O O O O O O O O

eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
bought for my daughter to take for starting college this fall - she has been on it non-stop ever since " learning how to use it " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
theres a built in camera with special effects - for video and photography .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O

looking to take my video and photo editing to the next level , i decided to purchase the mbp 15in intel core i5 after reading consumer reviews as well as professional reviews of this laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the speed is incredible and i am more than satisfied .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
a tip for people looking into this computer : do not buy it save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the most amazing part to me as a pc user is the startup and shutdown times - and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but you must get the 15 inch .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i could n't be more pleased .####O O O O O B-OP O
so , buyers beware !####O O O O O
i wanted it for it 's mobility and man , this little bad boy is very nice .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
kind of annoying , but i still love the laptop .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
but if you are in the computer field you probably would n't be here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but until now , no complains at all .####O O O O O O O O O
dell wanted to charge us for everything everytime i called them with a problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
/ awesome cooling system / much better graphics card ( ati 5870 ) / 8gb ram / led backlit screen ...####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i 'm now trying to decide on another dell model .####O O O O O O O O O O O
my macbook is probably the best investment i have ever made .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i thought it would be a simple job .####O O O O O O O O O
i have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is awsome !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
on the twelfth day that i had the notebook , i decided to go to dell 's website and update it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the investment of a new macbook pro came at a price , but totally worth it for a good piece of mind .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O
most laptops and notebooks are difficult to key on .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O
but as time went on i found it almost impossible to keep the thing on-line through wi-fi .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the criticism has waned , and now i 'd be the first to recommend an air for truly portable computing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it seems to be incompatible with everything else .####O O O O B-OP O O O O
the laptop preformed pretty well .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i think that was a great decision to buy####O O O O O B-OP O O O
they should have included more memory on their computers if they knew vista would run slowly .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i have been a pc user for a very long time now but i will get used to this new os .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
i should have checked this before i installed my applications .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
tried windows 8 and hated it !!!####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O
the letter a stopped working after the first week .####O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
after trying to get some help he disconnected on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O
then on top of it all their customer service center is in the middle east .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
it is well worth the money it cost , very good investment .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
i fine apple mc373ll/a 2.66 ghz 15 " macbook pro notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well i got this computer from best buy and i have had nothing but problems i bought the computer with a virus .....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the item received was exactly as identified .####O O O O O O O O
i complain again ...####O O O O
so if you move laptop a lot , it might get loose , however it sits pretty tightly .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
it started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in ( mousing over the battery icon would read , for example , " 74 % , plugged in , not charging " ) , requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

i will stack it up against laptops that cost twice as much any day .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
this mac mini does not have a built-in mic , and it would seem that its mac os 10.9 does not handle external microphones properly .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
this computer will last you at least 7 years , thats an amazing life spanned an electronic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i play a lot of casual games online , and the touchpad is very responsive .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
again , i sent it off to acer , by this time they were paying for me to send it to them and everything , but it was still inconvenient because of my classes and my communication with my fiance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i took it back to best buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
everything i have tried has worked and i never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i think this will happen to any new version of computer/phone released and i need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
love it love it love it !####B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O
i was also able to install and use my photoshop and after effects programs easily .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
fast , fast and fast , the web pages just fly by .####B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
if you 're looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphics-intensive game , you 'd be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
windows xp sp2 caused many problems on the computer , so i had to remove it .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i eventually did the migration from my imac backup disc which uses usb .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O
then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24 " lcd screen , so built in screen size is not terribly important .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
it 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a notebook .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
just for a stupid cd .####O O O B-OP O O
macs are designed for the " frontal lobe challenged " people out there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i think that anyone looking for a good durrable laptop then this is the way to go .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-OP O O O O O O O O O

a lot of help they were n't !####O O O O O O O O
i had to call hp and ask for a recovery disk because the computer does not come with one and completely redo it all .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my children wo n't even use it for their school work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O

i had to return it because it would n't even start .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
good monitor and performed well .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O
i hope this review helps .####O O O O O O
i am so happy to have purchased this computer .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small .####B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i ca n't say enough of how satisfied i am with their product and help aftermarket .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
this mac has been a problem since we got it .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the only problems are the sound is n't very loud i have to wear headphones .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O
they did n't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
none of the techs at hp knew what they were doing .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the graphics were awful and the warranty is n't even worth the cheap payment on the computer .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
quite simply this is the best laptop i have ever owned . #simply +1 , best +1####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
other than that , i would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O
the feature are good enough for what i need .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
then i 've fixed the dc jack ( inside the unit ) , rewired the dc jack to the outside of the laptop , replaced the power brick .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i have a friend who has the other model and we put them side by side with the same dvd in ( battle of the smithsonian ) after on hour mine was at 53 % life left and his was at 69 % life left .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in fact , he said , about 10 % of their products fail .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the one down side to it is that when i play a certain game on here , it tends to freeze up sometimes , but thats the only bad thing about this computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
keyboard is reasonable size .####B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
my sister has the same mac as me and she is in a band and uses garageband to record and edit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back , but the return calls never came .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is not best buy 's fault .####O O O O O O O O
i was told that it seems to be a multi - component failure .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when calling dell for help , return , or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
back she goes !####O O O O
i think it was around 16 hundred bucks last i checked .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it so much .####O B-OP O O O O
price and purpose is awesome !####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i took it in to the apple store and guess what ? they fixed it , no cost out of pocket .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like those programs better than office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the office programs as well .####O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
files as well would become lost , deleted or corrupted .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had the netbook for 2 months and i love it , i read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers i use .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the lesson learned here is : it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand , since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible , as fast as they can , and in this day and age , the customer no longer is right all the times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when i finally had everything running with all my software installed i plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
pairing it with an iphone is a pure pleasure - talk about painless syncing - used to take me forever - now it 's a snap .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apple is unmatched in product quality , aesthetics , craftmanship , and customer service .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i love windows 7 which is a vast improvment over vista .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
we purchase the dell xps several years ago for my home business .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well i spilled something on it and they replaced it with this model , which gets hot and the battery does n't make it through 1 dvd .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O
i am loving the fast performance also .####O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O
there is a blank lighted screen when i start and that is all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i saw the mini mac at best buy and decided to get this as my replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i use my friends and family 's $ 2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and hp , well , i 'll never buy or recommend an hp to anyone !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
! excellent performance , usability , presentation and time response .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
it will be returned in the state to which it was shipped michigan .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i investigated netbooks and saw the toshiba nb305-n410bl .####O O O O O O O O O
very powerful especially for the money .####O B-OP O O O O O
" for one , i noticed that from turning on my mac to logging on only took about 25 seconds .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
temperatures on the outside were alright but i did not track in core processing unit temperatures .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
they are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i bought this one for my 11 year old and the macbook air for my 9 year old .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her , it 's very lightweight , and the response for the computing she 's doing ( internet focused activity : mail , research , etc. ) is excellent ;####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
enjoy that toshiba force and durability unparalleled####B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP
other ports include firewire 800 , gigabit ethernet , magsafe port , microphone jack .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
but i was wrong .####O O O O O
i have owned macbook pros since 2005 and this is the best yet !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
usb3 peripherals are noticably less expensive than the thunderbolt ones .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O O
this laptop meets every expectation and windows 7 is great !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
buyers beware .####O O O
the extended warranty for the $ 4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the keyboard has a wonderful nature feel .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O
received the product promptly and without any issues .####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
i bought the netbook because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around .####O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
you can imagine that an expensive item as a laptop will not be left on your front steps , it needs signature to pove that you received it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
screen , keyboard , and mouse : if you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a mac the beautiful screen , responsive island backlit keyboard , and fun multi-touch mouse is worth the extra money to me alone .####B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
i had of course bought a 3 year warranty , so i sent it in to be replaced and ( almost 2 months later ) the dv4 is what the sent me as a replacement .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design .####O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
i 'm hoping the rest of the features will be the signature quality of apple .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
my only gripe would be the need to add more ram .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
*** the review below is no longer relevant , apple has fixed the issue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the delivery was fast , and i would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
just keep in mind the graphics is not dedicated so loading the movie almost took a minute , but it ran fairly smooth for a non-dedicated graphics card .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
it has plenty of memory , lots of hard drive , and great graphics .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
the mac mini is probably the simplest example of compact computing out there .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
i hate it .####O B-OP O O
i know there are way better laptops out there for the same price , and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesnt suck total monkey balls .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm a professional consultant , and a client needed work on her machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , it 's ok .####O O O O B-OP O
i went right out and purchased another laptop .####O O O O O O O O O
even so , i like playing online games , so it was wonderful that there is a feature where i can dual boot windows .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
with a mac you do n't have to worry about antivirus software or firewall , it 's so wonderful .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
it has been to early to see if this actually fixes the problem or not though .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm glad i made the choice to switch and buy this mac .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the windows 7 starter and not the full windows 7 .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it did n't come with any software installed outside of windows media , but for the price , i was very pleased with the condition and the overall product .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
they 're not safe , they 're not durable , they just a worthless .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-OP O
this one has had the same effect .####O O O O O O O O
the like new condition of the imac mc309ll/a on amazon is at $ 900 + level only , and it is a quad-core 2.5 ghz cpu ( similar to the $ 799 mini ) , with radeon hd 6750m 512mb graphic card ( this mini is integrated intel 4000 card ) , and it even comes with wireless apple keyboard and mouse , all put together in neat and nice package .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
we figure that after everything his pc actually ended up costing $ 350 more than my original mac .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
does everything i need it to , has a wonderful battery life and i could n't be happier .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
if that is the case , then i am completely happy####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP
its a pretty decent computer .####O O O B-OP O O
it 's also fairly easy to use the operating system .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
now , i guess , i 'll have to unload my m6809 on some poor , hapless soul .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was also cheaper than the pro which made it even more appealing to me .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
so , i went back .####O O O O O O
i wanted something that had a new intel core processors and hdmi port so that we could hook it up directly to our tv .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
great value , fast delivery - computer works as if brand new , no problems , very pleased####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP I-OP O O B-OP
the battery life is excellent , the display is excellent , and downloading apps is a breeze .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
could n't keep a page up you were working on !####O O O O O O O O O O O
i would rate this computer at 5 stars , but considering it has a short life span i can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
she told me flatly , " it 's like that one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love apple but unlike others that does not prevent me to not be honest about how i like it and if its good or not .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great product by apple with the new great looking design .####B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-OP O B-ASP O
there are several programs for school or office use ( pages , numbers , keynote , etc. ) , music ( garageband ) , photo management ( photo booth , iphoto ) , video-editing or movie-making ( imovie ) , etc .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O
images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
despite the claims of the apple apologists ( a vice of which i am recently myself reformed ) the internals of mac laptops are no different from pcs ' at this point .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this by far beats any computer out on the market today built well , battery life amazing .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
they claim that i should be happy because i am getting a new laptop to replace my two-month old laptop .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in my opinion it was not as user friendly as i expected either .####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
when considering a mac , look at the total cost of ownership and not just the initial price tag .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
they are so realistic i am just speechless .####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
its fast and another thing i like is that it has three usb ports .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
since i never really got to use this , i ca n't comment on anything except what went wrong after trying 2 of them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

one suggestion i do have , is to not bother getting microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a pc .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

while lacking some of the functions of the other versions , this was very acceptable for the uses planned for this computer .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O

i like itunes , the apparent security , the mini form factor , all the nice graphics stuff .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O

i have the a65 - right now it 's a paperweight .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was told by many that it was a great computer , but we got one of these , and it worked great for one year , and as soon as the warrenty was up , then it got really bad .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
small enough to use on a long flight , light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips .####B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the ease in which you set everything up is such that a child could do it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen is nice , side view angles are pretty good .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O

big mistake !####O O O
another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $ 175 to send it in to fix it .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had the macbook pro 15 for about three weeks , and it really is a great computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O

runs very smoothly .####B-ASP O B-OP O
this process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
i had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a " different " computer .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
of course my warranty runs out next month .####O O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O
so , i must say i am not a happy camper .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't have any technical pearls to share .####O O O O O O O O O O
i will never buy another hp computer .####O O O O O O O O
so ? how can you solve it ? c'mon , i just bought the netbook 2 weeks ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is easily portable and i take it everywhere i go and might require internet access .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i love this little one .####O B-OP O O O O
i would easly recommend this laptop to a friend .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
my first problem was with the pre-loaded norton firewall/security program .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
now the machine wo n't connect and toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in may but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now i 'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since i bought the netbook .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp .####O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
but , like i said before , the only reason i do n't currently have a mac laptop is because all of their laptops are too pricey .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hopefully my replacement is brand new .####O O O O O O O
the notebook is lacking a hdmi port and a s-video port that would enable one to hook it to a tv .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
hope this helped !####O O O O

i 'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100 % that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was also suffering from hardware ( keyboard ) issues , relatively slow performance and shortening battery lifetime .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
not a bad laptop , it 's a bit slow , but gets the job done .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
if you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core amd or intel processor .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O

i bought mine from apple store the day it was released as amazon did n't have it yet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's not a wear-and-tear issue , not due to user carelessness and most importantly , they ca n't guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and i have to accept the outcome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O

all you have to do is turn it on and it works .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

they do n't seem to be susceptible to viruses , which is one less big thing to worry about when it comes to computers .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O

there was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system ca n't be used with the ibook .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O
the service tech said he had tried to duplicate the damage and was n't able to recreate it therefore it had to be their defect .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

so far , it 's an average laptop - no better , no worse than the hp i replaced .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O

but guess what ? ( you have to buy an external dvd drive it does n't have a built in type ) the notebook ca n't be used because it does n't read anything for an external drive .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

the backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the bluetooth was not there at all , and the fingerprint reader driver would be there , but the software would hang after installation was 1/2 way done .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that bums me out about this purchase is they released a newer updated mbp seriously right after i bought this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was old but it was not till we bought the dell did we realize how great it was .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O

if i had to buy another computer , i would most definetly buy an acer one computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
but it has a major design flaw .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
btw , i checked online regarding the old laptop that ' died ' and found that i was not alone , far from it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

however , the machine itself left a bit to be desired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
luckily i had a student task force able to help , or else it would have crashed within the first year .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there is no need to purchase virus protection for mac , which saves me a lot of time and money .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
after purchasing this thing , i find out that i need a special interface device to connect my camera , and that it can not be purchased at the store - only on line .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

let me start off by saying that i was highly reluctant to spend so much money on a laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
it took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that i owned the warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

i would n't play a first-person shooter with this , mind , but if you wanted to run ms office , email , chat , download a video , listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store , and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in , i 'd highly recommend checking this out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O

in all honesty , if someone is looking for a quality laptop and willing to pay a little more money for a normal sized laptop than a cheaper and less impressive laptop , then do not buy this computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it makes sorting out all those photos on my digital camera a breeze , and organizing them by place , time taken , or sending them to an online print shop , or uploading them to flickr or facebook etc , is not hard at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O

as a computer science student in college , i find that the portability , longevity , and ease of use of this computer make me ( shockingly ) want to do homework more ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i love the feel of the key board , as well as the trackpad .####O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
the toshiba net book operates very well .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
my previous purchases were with dell and hp .####O O O O O O O O O
will certainly use macconnection again .####O O O O O O
have used only macs for years .####O O O O O O O
i was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews , but i 've found it fine to work with .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
there is no hdmi receptacle , nor is there an sd card slot located anywhere on the device .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i use my mac all the time , i love the software , the way it takes a short time to load things , how easy it is to use and most of all how you do n't have to worry about viruses .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i just recently had to ship my laptop back to hp for repair .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought it from hsn because it was " bundled " with extra software , but as it turns out , that software just crashes it more often .....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
one of the smartest thing i did was take my time to compare laptops before making my purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the macbook pro 's physical form is wonderful .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the service i received from toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
so i 'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
looking online , many people are having the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O
oh yea , has no numeric pad on the side .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
when i am next to my router on my hp i get full service , on my eee pc i get 3 bars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
okay , let 's just start out by saying i am in no way a computer techy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm the pro-active type so i went off and did some preventative fixes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but sadly the replacement froze-up while updating the bios again and shut down and would not turn back on .####O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
how does the power supply not work !!!####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
so i called customer support ( which is good too ) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all , i just chose to hide the message .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
it gets stuck all of the time you use it , and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i especially like the backlit keyboard .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the acer one computer is a great computer .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
i made a perfect decision when i bought the toshiba !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i bought it for college and so far it 's amazing !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
if it 's not shipped on the next business day , called on a friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sounds like a typewriter , but if you can get past that , this is a great laptop for a little money !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
after years of using pcs , a new mac user is basically forced to re-learn how to use a computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
before , i reloaded with windows 7 ultimate and used only the downloaded drivers from acer 's site .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
it 's a mac !!####O O O O O
it is really easy to use and it is quick to start up .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
great deal on an amazing lap top !####B-OP O O O B-OP O O O
this wiped out several programs that were installed on the computer when it was bought .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
everything was so easy .####O O O B-OP O
i needed a new computer for graduate school ( had never owned a laptop before ) , and the only reason i did n't purchase a mac was because my school 's website strongly recommended students purchase pcs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
mostly i love the drag and drop feature .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
not even safe mode boots .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
i purchased this laptop 9 months ago !####O O O O O O O O
taking it anywhere was a pain !####O O O O O B-OP O
those moments in time where you want to throw something against the wall ? yeah , i wanted to throw that laptop out the window and light it on fire .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they only stay charged a little over an hour .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
that 's right , no power , absolutely nothing .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
three weeks after i bought the netbook , the screen quit working .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
problem fixed which is great but there went another two weeks without my laptop at school .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can read all about the details of this marvelous computer on wikipedia .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i found the mini to be : exceptionally easy to set up####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP
only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation apple doesnt provide any kind of word processor ( such as works for windows ) , but iwork is cheap compared to office .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the screen is huge and colorful , but no led backlighting .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
i just love this laptop , i just wish it were all silver or they had all black .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ca n't even install one of the 3 printers i have in my house so i am unable to print .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
in my house , hp is a nasty word .####O O O O O O O O O O
it weighed like seven pounds or something like that .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i 've been a pc user and i just finally switched and i am never going back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hp refused to give me a new one and wal mart refused to take it back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
keyboard could use some trimming .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i love the keyboard and the screen .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
i like the design and its features but there are somethings i think needs to be improved .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a bit heavy .####O O O O B-OP O
the ease of use is wonderful .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
really no problems with the hand me down computers i received from my children .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have owned it only two months !####O O O O O O O O
programs would crash all the time , and it turned out to be a very unstable , unreliable laptop for me .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O
the difference is the toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
not using wired lan not sure what thats about .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
this is great if you have several lectures back to back and do n't have a chance to charge during one of the lectures .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
system is running great .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
this is my first personal satellite purchase but had very good experience through previous satellite work issued laptops .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O
out of the box i noticed how small it was and was exactly what i was looking for .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
they basically told me that the machine would be problem free now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so buyer beware when buying toshiba####O O O O O O
i was extremely happy with the os itself .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O
pay attention to the specs if you want these options .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the touch pad is fine - again , it 's a real touch pad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
after much battling with hp i was able to return it 4 times for repairs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm no regular customer i hate wasting my time with hellos and how can i help you 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has been plagued with problems since the day i turned it on .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i grew up in a design family so it only made sense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all my devises “ talk ” to each other .####O O O O O O O O O O
it could n't have been a better decision .####O O O O O O O O O
do i like the computer ? well , other than not getting viruses , i guess it is ok .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i 'm just really happy that i waited to buy , because this thing kicks a $ $ !####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , one of the users mentioned how the edges on the macbook is sharp , if you have money to spend on one of the incase shells , it does n't seem to be a problem .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
clear picture on it and everything .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
i had upgraded my old macbook to lion , so i kind of knew what i was getting , but had n't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i was disappointed when i realized that the keyboard does n't light up on this model .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the internet was locked and froze every time it was trying to be used , and the command prompt would not work at all .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
i told them that i just received my brand new macbook but i was having issues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i never tried any external mics with that imac .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
but in fact it is totally the opposite .####O O O O O O O O O
here are the things that made me confident with my purchase : build quality - seriously , you ca n't beat a unibody construction .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the sound is a bit quiet if you 're on a plane , this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is extremely fast and never lags .####O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O
it works great and i am so happy i bought it .####O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
they would repair one thing , send it back and it would still have the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i used to build my own desktops from the component parts , and recently my 7 year old pentium 4 with ht 1 gb ram sata desktop stopped working ( this was a rock star 7 years ago ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
however i chose two day shipping and it took over a week to arrive .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the toshiba satellite laptop is designed to fail !####O O O O O O O B-OP O
i do n't understand why only windows 7 starter is included .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O
that is pretty sad when they name them specifically .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i was n't a big fan of the netbooks but this one was very well designed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the casing of the power cord fried and shocked my husband when he pulled it out of the socket .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
and looks very sexy :d really the mac book pro is the best laptop specially for students in college if you are not caring about price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it has surpassed all expectations and fulfilled all my needs .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i miss are the " home/end " type keys and other things that i grew accustomed to after so long .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first when i got this product , i loved it .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it has all the features that we expected and the price was good , working well so far .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O
very light and easily maneuverable .####O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O
this computer is the ideal college companion .####O O O O B-OP O O O
put a cover on it and is a little better but that is my only complaint .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
love the speed , especially !####B-OP O B-ASP O O O
originally bought it for my wife .####O O O O O O O
and i babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
honestly , i am surprised no one else has mentioned returning theirs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the multi-touch trackpad .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
easy to start up and does not overheat as much as other laptops .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
sure it 's not light and slim but the features make up for it 100 % .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i do not know for sure .####O O O O O O O
this one still has the cd slot .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
features like the font are very block-like and old school .####B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O
i like coming back to mac os but this laptop is lacking in speaker quality compared to my $ 400 old hp laptop .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it lasted for many years of travel , kids and abuse and if i fired it up today , it would work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i go to purchase it on line , and i find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
im glad that it has such great features in it .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
speakers too small to be of any real use .####B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
this is something i would deffinately recommend to someone .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O
you wo n't be disappointed .####O O O O B-OP O
by the way teachers , they offer a discount which helps !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would rather spend my money on a computer that costs more than a toshiba that is n't good at all .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
you have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of network capability .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
another issue i have with it is the battery .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O
this computer had exactly the specifications i needed .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O
the quality , engineering design and warranty are superior -- covers damage from dropping the laptop .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it freezes , and it always shows that there is an error , so i have to restart it a few times every time i use it .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i saw the bad reviews from people saying to buy directly from apple and i was concerned but i took my chances and am overly impressed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it still heats up like mad and i am unable to use it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the graphics are stunning .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
she tells me about it all the time but i tend to shut off all cognitive functions when she gets that yapper going .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance , picture quality , and ease of use .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
in early may i got it back and this time i only had it back for 1 day before it had a new issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they " expedited " the repairs so i was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed , by a " senior tech " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
i cant believe hp put this out .####O O O O O O O O
i just bought this laptop 3 days ago .####O O O O O O O O O
the latest is on my lg netbook x12####O O O O O O O O
the only pro to this computer is it was under $ 600 !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mac version of microsoft office is cheaper than buying the actual and works just as well .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O

i also love the small , convenient size of my laptop , making it a perfect tool for my academic studies .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a decent computer for the price and hopefully it will last a long time .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it absolutely is more expensive than most pc laptops , but the ease of use , security , and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O
it is made better , thicker , and all out tough !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
i would buy it again in a heartbeat !####O O O O O O O O O
what 's really great about this product is you may have a family member who is computer illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on this computer without any real supervision .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

let 's just get this out of the way , i love apple !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components , and i 'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator , but i still expected better product quality for this price range .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O

if i have a problem with any of my apple items i make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is easy to operate and i have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new rolls royce of laptops .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
until i bought the dell , i thought you just looked for what you wanted ( size , software , options , hardware ) and purchase the best deal you could find .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O

the battery life is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i got the black macbook two years ago and have never regretted it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
this time the mouse pad and right click key would n't work !####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the laptop is very lightweight , can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight .####O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
we carry the netbook around here and there , hence it 's kinda of irritating when the lcd just " slide " downwards .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it definitely beats my old mac and the service was great .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i tried several monitors and several hdmi cables and this was the case each time .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O

the built-in webcam is great for skype and similar video-chat services .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
it was a waste of money from day one !####O O O O O O O O O O
i spent months looking for a good laptop for me and i finally found it !####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O

i highly recommend this product !####O B-OP I-OP O O O
i am sorry that i purchased this laptop .####O O O O O O O O O

see when it comes to laptops you buy it and get just a normal operating system with trials of must need stuff that should come with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , i can refute that osx is " fast " .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O

here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this thing is a lemon .####O O O O O O
i went from bestbuy to dell , windows to apple .####O O O O O O O O O O O
also it comes with very useful applications like iphoto that it is the best photo application i have ever had####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
( the ibook backup also uses a firewire connection ) .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
even though it is running snow leopard , 2.4 ghz c2d is a bit of an antiquated cpu and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running office mac applications such as word or excel .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i am very happy !####O O O B-OP O
so , i took it back to the apple store and they ( narcissist genius bar staff ) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
and this is n't just my one experience .####O O O O O O O O O

i was always against them but now i buying one i 'll never go back to pc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O
everything about a mac is wonderful , it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system , but you will learn fast and its all worth it .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-OP O O
since i have always used apple products , the choice of macbook pro was obvious .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the first laptop i 've owned , although i used several at my previous job .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is her first laptop and she is thrilled .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i made the right decision .####O O O B-OP O O
i really wanted a mac over a pc because i used a mac in high school .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i my wife is also now the proud owner of a macbook as well !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this mac book pro along with a new 27 " imac and while they are still light years more reliable than a pc i have noticed a decline in the reliability of my mac computers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
if you already own a 2009 , 2010 , or early 2011 model , you should wait until the next update .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's applications are terrific , including the replacements for microsoft office .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
looks nice , but has a horribly cheap feel .####B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O
since the machine 's slim profile is critical to me , that was a problem .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
another satisfied customer .####O B-OP O O
this was purchased for my daughter and i was pleasantly surprised .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
if internet connectivity is important i would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more , or buy a usb wireless card .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
if you are looking for something reliable , this is the laptop for you .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O

screen - although some people might complain about low res which i think is ridiculous .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
with awesome graphics and assuring security , it 's perfect !####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O
if you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get a mac !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is extremely user friendly and intuitive .####O O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP O
it is small enough to fit in one of my purses !####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O
right size and weight for portability .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
finally , i should note that i took the 2gb ram stick from my old eeepc and installed it before i even powered on for the first time .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when my dell laptop gave up only after 2-1/2 years , i decided to buy macbook pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's been time for a new laptop , and the only debate was which size of the mac laptops , and whether to spring for the retina display .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i love it !####O B-OP O O
in short i would never buy a compaq again .####O O O O O O O O O O
it has no camera but , i can always buy and install one easy .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
a couple months later , they change my hard drive .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

i tried giving it 0 stars but i had to choose at least one , but imo no stars####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
enabling the battery timer is useless .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
after paying over $ 1000 for this computer , it was not worth it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
i was given a demonstration of windows 8 .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it is very well built .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this " never " happen ...####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the price and what i get out of it has exceeded my expectations .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16 " laptop does .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphones / mic , not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i understand i should call apple tech support about any variables ( which is my purpose of writing this con ) as variables could be a bigger future problem .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the brand of itunes has just become ingrained in our lexicon now , but keep in mind that apple started it all .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the technical support was not helpful as well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O
they are simpler to use .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i did have to replace the battery once , but that was only a couple months ago and it 's been working perfect ever since .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use , very important for use quick typers .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
so when i had the money to buy one i bought other things instead ... a 700 laptop and some extra stuff with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
now they are believers in the product .####O O O O O O O O
navigation through the computer is far superior compared to windows operating systems , as well .####B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
so i got another netbook which i love !####O O O O O O O B-OP O
