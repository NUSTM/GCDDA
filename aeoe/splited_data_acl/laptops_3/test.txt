my house is now 100 % macbook .####O O O O O O O O
another problem .####O O O
huge apple mac fan !####O O O O O
if i have a few hundred dollars to spare , i 'd buy the pro line though , the 2.53 and 2.66 ghz model .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery is not as shown in the product photos .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i had the bulk of problems with my lap top within the first six months .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
so , i paid a visit to lg notebook service center at alexandra road , hoping they can make the hinge tighter .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
the whole experience is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
ideal for someone on the go or for a high school students .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my favorite by far , although the most expensive , was my sony .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
the mousepad is a huge pain in the arse !####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
there is a backlit keyboard which is perfect for typing in the dark .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
the new os is great on my macbook pro !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
the screen is gorgeous - yummy good .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O
it is more than enough computer to keep up with the needs of a high school student .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
had to have this computer repaired twice in the first 5 months after purchasing it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's not inexpensive but the hardware performance is impressive for a computer this small .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
i have dropped mine a couple times with only a slim plastic case covering it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O
it did fairly well , other than it 's poor performance , overheating and occational blue screen .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
then to make matters worst , there is noone that they can transfer you to .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm going back to pc .####O O O O O O O
when the computer has been on for several minutes , it will occasionaly just go off by itself .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the newer macbook that i have purchased is one of the best computers .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i love the operating system and the preloaded software .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i needed something affordable from apple and was tired of dealing with pc laptop after pc laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and i am praying it has finally stopped .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the apple pro notebook will not let you down .####O O O O O O O O O O
recently there are a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
in the shop , these macbooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and use it ( very clever con ) .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this laptop looked brand new and was shipped very quickly .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
of course , for a student , weight is always an issue .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i bought this macbook pro to replace my six-year-old pc ( a sony vaio ) , but it was basically no better than my old pc , so i returned it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
breaking within 1 year of purchase and speaking to 4 + people to report the damaged part will be returned late !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it works fine , and all the software seems to run pretty well .####O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
a couple things you should know :####O O O O O O O
i love ths notebook .####O B-OP O O O
it took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it s heavy for mac book but is good .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
came with iphoto and garage band already loaded .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
so you might ask , what did apple do for me ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O
sadly apple has discontinued this macbook , i think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller pros .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the machine itself is alright .####O O O O B-OP O
the price is higher than most lab top out there ; however , he/she will get what they paid for , which is a great computer .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i can not be happier with the service or product .####O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O O O
i would have to say that overall its great !####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it may take a little getting used to but you do n't have to worry about viruses or other headaches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
graphics are clean and sharp , internet interfaces are seamless .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
yeah , it 's super expensive .####O O O O O B-OP O
it has good speed and plenty of hard drive space .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
so this was great for me .####O O O B-OP O O O
laptop is advertised as a 15 " but the casing looks like that of a 17 " .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to work####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
summary : they played games with me for the warranty period .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the performance seems quite good , and built-in applications like iphoto work great with my phone and camera .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
i should have been more observant .####O O O O O O O
for the use it was purchased for it is a good laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the computer itself was fast , ran smoothly , and had no problems .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
the reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me ( i prefer it dark ) or if you can crank up the brightness .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the os is fast and fluid , everything is organized and it 's just beautiful .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
best buy was great as always and accepted the return and gave me another model 1764 .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did n't like one thing about it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college .####B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
not sure how i recommend it for quality gaming , as i have a desktop rig for that reason .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
they ended up keeping my computer for almost 3 months !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the 17 in macbook pro has been a wonderful addition .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
took that one home , same thing .####O O O O O O O O
i love the size , keyboard , the functions .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O

i am very happy with my first mac .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
i bought it to my son who uses it for graphic design .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
set up was easy .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
a longer battery life would have been great - but it meets it 's spec quite easily .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the screen takes some getting use to , because it is smaller than the laptop .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
good in every aspect .####B-OP O O O O
awesome graphics !####B-OP B-ASP O
it 's so quick and responsive that it makes working / surfing on a computer so much more pleasurable !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
i love the apple products .####O B-OP O O O O
as usual at customer service center , she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague ( i could see them ) .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will be returning it and switching brands when i get to best buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
i know apples are more expensive than pcs , but he thinks it is worth every penny .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
that included the extra sony sonic stage software , the speakers and the subwoofer i got ( that was worth the money ) , the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer , the extended life battery and the docking port .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
from the get-go , the m6809 was unsteady in its operation ;####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
purchased for development purposes , but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing , e-mail , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
you will not regret it , promise you !####O O O O O O O O O
no i am generous calling it slow .####O O O O O O B-OP O
steve jobs , probably needs help and donations , and can not afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices , and usb devices are recognized almost instantly .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
i can actually get work done with this mac , and not fight with it like my tired old pc laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not to mention , the battery life is absolutely amazing .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a big big , but since it has a 18.4 " screen what would you expect !####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
when i got this laptop in 2007 to help me with school , i had a hard time from beginning .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i love the mac so much better than my work pc !####O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
please make these !####O O O O
may be better for the occasional web surfer .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
no complaints with their desktop , and maybe because it just sits on your desktop , and you do n't carry it around , which could jar the hard drive , or the motherboard .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O
i first purchased this dell model " 1764 " on april 6 , 201####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

took it back as it was defective .####O O O O O O B-OP O
i bought it for really cheap also and it 's amazing .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
the macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
the sound was crappy even when you turn up the volume still the same results .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O

it would n't fit in most 17-inch bags .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
with the macbook pro it comes with free security software to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , macbooks come with much more features which are so cool !####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O
you may just lose 1 customer for now .####O O O O O O O O O
would like more trendy , high tech features .####O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O
if you really want a bang-up system and do n't need to run windows applications , go with an apple ;####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
( the sata controller is the motherboard chip that lets the cpu talk to the hard drive . )####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
summary : hp knew they were shipping out bad bios and did nothing proactive to resolve it .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O

my trackpad is not working .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
i got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime i touched the lid , ( mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed ) but i suffered thru it and would constantly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O

it seems they could have updated xp and done without creating vista .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
the so called laptop runs to slow and i hate it !####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O
did n't work when shipped from walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop ( same make/model ) .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one drawback , i wish the keys were backlit .####O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O

very annoying .####O B-OP O
i also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O

after numerous calls to applecare tech support , i was directed to send in my computer ;####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O

our apple 13.3 macbook pro notebook computer ( z0j80001 ) notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

returned laptop for a 3rd repair and it came back with previous problems fixed ( except for speaker grill ) but the unit started locking up during use and eventually would not operate at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mouse is a little bit different than what you 're used to though - it has one big flat panel and one full bar ( instead of two separate ones ) to click with - but you get used to it quite quickly .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that does n't require a dedicated video card .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i use this for my tutoring business , and since i 'm always bouncing from student to student , it is ideal for portability and battery life ( yes , it gets the 8 hours as advertised ! ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it 's shiny and it 's pretty .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
but sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough ( this could be because im used to my lenovo 10 tablet now ) plus this is a great size if i want to unplug the external keyboard , mouse , and monitor to take it with me when i take photos and video .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O

thank you so much for the great item .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
i have to wonder why amazon is even selling this dinosaur .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
my one complaint with this laptop is that i 've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
" i 've had it now about 2 months and absolutely love it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
so needless to day , i 'm not happy .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i wish iwork or ms office came with the mac , but ms office does n't even come with most pc laptops .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
seems a much more economical way to get into apple than their other computers .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
this computer gets very hot , before shutting down .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
the speakers could have been better but it was n't a deal breaker ... this is a great little laptop ... love it !####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
although my model was listed as recalled , hp denied my claim .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership , so it was covered by the applecare warranty plan .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
it 's a mac !!####O O O O O
nothing about it that i do n't love , apple always makes a great product .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O
it also does not have bluetooth .####O O O O O B-ASP O
luckily , dell said they would replace my laptop with a new one , but instead i got a refund and bought a mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my macbook pro is no exception .####O O O O O O O
i waited another month for approval and for them to " build " me a new laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but i was completely wrong , this computer is unbelievable amazing and easy to use .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
i 've installed to it additional ssd and 16gb ram .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
before i got my macbook , i owned a dell laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i pondered very long over this decision .####O O O O O O O O
yeah , to you .####O O O O O
returned laptop for a 4th repair and it came back but now would lock up and randomly reboot frequently making the laptop unusable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
so noise is reduced at least 50 % and the heat is much better , now it does n't feel hot but warm .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
it works fine with our wireless and they 've had not problems .####O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this laptop looks great on the surface : 17 " inch screen , good price-point , nice appearance , boots up quickly , runs fast etc .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O
10/10 five stars would recommend .####O B-OP I-OP O B-OP O
it discharges too quickly .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i was a little worry at first because i do n't have a lot of experience with os.x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
a scratch on a $ 1,500 macbook is unforgivable .####O O O O O O O O O O
i realize that not every unit has this issue , but the ones that do can not be repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it super shiny , so you can see the fingerprints easily .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O
this machine is amazing .####O O O B-OP O
anyways i bought this two months ago and when i first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporarily in save zone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
drivers updated ok but the bios update froze the system up and the computer shut down .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
lightweight and the screen is beautiful !####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
in due course , i 'll remove the hard disc from this new macbook pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ok , this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by apple .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
my husband got me this for chrismas after getting me a very expensive laptop that did not work after 2 days .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
frustrated i hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very nice so far .####O B-OP O O O
( if you ever see the spinning beachball come up when you think it should n't , check the " activity monitor " app to see if the disk throughput has temporarily dropped to zero .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
it has been nothing but trouble from the time we bought it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen is nice and the images comes very clear , the keyboard and the fit just feels right .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
sorry toshiba , but 1st impressions do count for something .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i have owned many computers and laptops .####O O O O O O O O
the case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
the apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you : )####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i expected so as it 's an apple product , but i was glad to see my expectations exceeded , this is the laptop to buy right now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
emachines says they 're waiting for a part and refuses to replace entire unit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while the keyboard itself is alright , the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
thank god for " ctrl z " bottom line , i 've been using laptops since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i always swore by pcs and would never consider a mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , i have alot of trouble with it getting very hot , and not even sitting on anything to make it hot .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not a scratch or mark on it .####O O O O O O O O
let me tell you , this machine is great .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it also came with a built it web cam which is great because i can see an communicate with my family members back home .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i stayed up half the night enjoying my new macbook pro .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i had a macbook notebook , and it had absolutely no protection from viruses , spyware , malware , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if this would be your first mac purchase then i would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between mac and pc 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but i did n't want to spend another thousand on a laptop since my work already provides me with a pc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the macbook pro is very sturdy and versatile .####O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook , it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
being a pc user for many years to switch to a mac i will not go back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have no problems yet on my mac so far , and hope it stays like that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase####O O O O O O O O O
the new macbook is light-years ahead of my old white plastic macbook circa 2006 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh my goodness - i am not a happy camper .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i only used it to browse the internet and and i dont know how many times it has spontaneously shut down and it is just a blank screen now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the programs that come standard with the leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
they sent it off and within 2 weeks i had it back good as new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
what i 'd like is for the laptop to run well without having to purchase additional memory .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
do not buy it !####O O O O O
ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about my mac .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i feel that enough people have macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did swap out the hard drive for a samsung 830 ssd which i highly recommend .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
it is very easy for anyone to use an apple and specially the macbook pro notebook .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the worst a mac ever did to me was freeze up .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it did everything we expected !####O O O O O O
the system it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the laptop is relatively simple to use , though i bought macs for dummies , which is well worth $ 2####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
still under warrenty so called toshiba , no help at all .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O
again in february my computer completely failed to the point that it could not load windows so i contacted acer to get it fixed thru my warrenty and it took about 3 days fighting on the phone with agents and it seemed as though none of them spoke english .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
" then i proceed to tell her that i checked out other retail stores that carry the netbook and it was n't like that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- i propose that they can just swap the hard drives .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
so when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the awesomest of the awesomest .####O B-OP O O B-OP O
perfect -- thanks so .####B-OP O O O O
anyway , in early july of this year , the dvd burner stopped working , and the computer stared having issues with power supply .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the mcbook pro notebook will make it easy for you to write and read your emails at blazing speeds .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
without a doubt , the * design * of this laptop is fantastic .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
the os is great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
it was fast , and it was " different " .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O
as an owner of a toshiba satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this device has met my expectations and i 'm sure it will meet yours .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the genius at the apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had another mac , but it got slow due to an older operating system .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
dells are ok , hps are n't that good , but macs are fantastic .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
again , the same problem , the right speaker did not work .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
it is meant to be portable .####O O O O O O O
there are no gold key numbers to install programs , you must use the serial numbers that it does not accept and then things are limited as far a working because they are only good for a short time .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can have both osx and windows xp running at the same time !####O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
it 's all a bit magical .####O O O O O B-OP O
had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i ' have had it for about a 1-1/2 and yes i have had an issue with it one month out of warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O
i love this laptop , and use it everyday to do something , and never lets me down .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one drawback i noticed was sound quality via usb .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the macbook rarely requires a hard reboot .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i 've already recommended this laptop to a friend who eye 'd the computer when i took it out of my bag .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i edit and burn to dvd a lot of video , so i obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
so , i 'm cooled on mac buys .####O O O O O O O O O
we researched and found the best price at macconnection .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
it all just makes sense .####O O O O O O
they break down just as often as pcs do , and the only reason they do n't get viruses , is because no one makes viruses for them , they 're not better in any way , they are worse , try finding virus protection programs for a mac , they do n't exist .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i will not be using that slot again .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O
one year of trying to fix the computer by myself , with help of friends , and even help from computer experts i have given up on trying to fix it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes , the most common being a corrupted version of appleworks which can render the browser useless .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
of course , i also have several great software packages that came for free including iwork , garageband , and imovie .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
apple and guess what , you have to send the whole laptop in , too bad , so sad####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP
i bought it to be able to dedicate a small , portable laptop to my writing and was surprised to learn that i needed to buy a word processing program to do so .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
they are not .####O O O O
i have used different laptops in the past and i have to rate this one way above the rest .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O
do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i absolutely love my mac !####O O B-OP O O O
overall i am very satisfied with the purchase .####O O O O B-OP O O O O
you pay for what you get for .####O O O O O O O O
this is no exception .####O O O O O
and i would recommend this to anyone looking for a new laptop .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
from the start , when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
previous laptops were pc 's , still have them , but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it has spent more time in repair shops than i can possibly recount here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's just a great toy to have around .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
the mac mini , wireless keyboard / mouse and a hdmi cable is all i need to get some real work done .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
this is why i purchased a brand new laptop in the first place so it would n't have any problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i believe with apple - you get what you pay for .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
when you look at the specs on apple products in comparison to a dell or a hp , yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
easy to install also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for adsl cable or wifi .####B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent ...####O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i just fell in love with this thing .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O
i left the place angrily .####O O O O O O
this is a review of windows vista system .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
once you go mac , you ca n't go back !####O O O O O O O O O O O
it has a .1 ghz faster processor and a stock 500gb hard drive .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary product key .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
we both recently got new laptops .####O O O O O O O
seems to me that 's the best way to get apple 's attention .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while most people say that pcs hold functionality and value and macs are just pretty to look at , i think there 's something to be said about the simplicity of macs .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
the biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
i started having problems with it within the first month .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the battery holds up well , it 's built very solidly , and runs fast .####O B-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O
the one thing that apple does right is computers .####O O O O O O O O O O
i sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for me , keys were starting to get stuck and would n't type very well .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
another thing i might add is the battery life is excellent .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
as of a couple weeks ago the middle portion of the laptop from top to bottom , , , about 4 inches across is hardly visible .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally , the biggest problem has been tech support .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i am taking back today .####O O O O O O
this computer does everything i need it to do for school and more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
learning all of the keyboard shortcuts only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts are the same on windows machines .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
after doing cad work all day at work , using a higher end pc , i could n't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i do n't understand is that the resolution of the screen is n't high enough for some pages , such as yahoo!mail .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O

i honestly love my mac , thats why i am a self proclaimed mac addict .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and toshiba is a quality supplier .####O O O O O O O
the flaws are , this computer is not for computer gamers because of the os x .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i only wish this mac had a cd/dvd player built in .####O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
being a tech savvy , apple - product loving person , i 'm glad i finally got the macbook pro !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O

the only thing i miss is that my old alienware laptop had backlit keys .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i 'm not exaggerating when i say this computer is perfect ... it is !!####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
we love the size of the screen , although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
this laptop serves all my needs .####O O O O O O O
the " abuse " is that i pushed the power plug in too hard .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
unfortunately , it runs xp and microsoft is dropping support next april .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O
just what the doctor ordered .####O O O O O O
it is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an alienware gaming machine .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
suffice it to say , my macbook pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
people know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i will have to say that i love my macbook pro !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
it rarely works and when it does it 's incredibly slow .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
overall it 's an amazing product , 5 stars !####O O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O
everything is falling apart internally and externally .####O O O O O O O O
still trying to learn how to use it .####O O O O O O O O O
the machine has a bluray player the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your hdtv .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
from the build quality to the performance , everything about it has been sub-par from what i would have expected from apple .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
could n't have asked for more !####O O O O O O O

the program came with the computer and works beautifully .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O

im very happy with this computer !####O O B-OP O O O O
toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and i am not kidding you , i called different hours of the day and you 'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they do n't have your history list of your calls right in front of them .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
is this partially due to the fact that it is running windows vista ?####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is a great value for the money .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
how toshiba handles the repair seems to vary , some folks indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix , others had the repair done 5 times .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that i was looking for .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she 'd recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
am very glad i bought it , great netbook , low price .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
windows 7 starter is terrific ( no you ca n't change the background ) but i do n't need to , i use it just for school work .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they went through asking me open up various components , taking battery out , hard disk apart , and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the apple systems are over priced luxurys that are n't worth what they are being charged for , this model 's specifications are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it makes a great gift .####O O O B-OP O O
update : two years after buying this laptop , i am now the proud owner of a lemon .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
put a ssd and use a 21 " led screen , this set up is silky smooth !####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
apple " help " is a mixed bag .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
also ... - excellent operating system - size and weight for optimal mobility - excellent durability of the battery - the functions provided by the trackpad is unmatched by any other brand -####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
go for it !####O O O O
the battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still i think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
i 'm overall pleased with the interface and the portability of this product .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
screen is crystal clear , yes it 's small - but it 's a netbook !####B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the difference is phenomenal .####O O O O O
but there 's this application called boot camp which allows you to add another os x like windows .####O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
it really is perfect for work and play .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
eventually my battery would n't charge , so unless i had it plugged in it would n't even power on .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i still see the benefits of a pc when i do not know how to do something on my mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to !####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
so of course this one came through with the awesomeness !####O O O O O O O O O O O
also stunning colors and speedy####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP
screen is awesome , battery life is good .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
and that probably explains why i 've already had my sata controller go bad within a year of buying it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
and that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
winters is on it 's way and i imagine it will be cozy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no luck , although i waited for hours on the phone-visited machouse , they stated the their call center is down due to too many phone calls ( difficult to believe ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had the same reasons as most pc users : the price , the overbearing restrictions of osx and lack of support for games .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
apple did a great job .####O O O B-OP O O
i ordered four d620 laptops .####O O O O O O

you 'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the computer is a dream come true .####O O O O O O O O
this netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop ( my wife and i have another laptop ) , or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my review mainly talks about the difference i have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

no hassle and no complaints .####O O O O O O
i am loyal to apple .####O O O O O O
i loved it then , but unfortunately it was before the days of wireless internet .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was kind of a rebellion against pc in fact , and i am certainly glad i did .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i have had it 9 months and it is already a $ 250 loss .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
completely worth every single penny dime and nickel .####O B-OP O O O O O O O
it is so simple to use , i use it more than my desktop .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box , all the functions works great .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
and if you are a game player it works with world of warcraft wonderfully .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
first it burned or fused the power adapter plug .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
it want take it , it keep saying error .####O O O O O O O O O O
in addition , all the design tools on pages and keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i had static in the output , and i had to reduce the sound output quality to " fm " as opposed to the default " cd .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
incredible graphics and brilliant colors .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the guy then said that if i insist on having the hinge tightened , they can do it for me but i have to accept the condition after the " repair " .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i really do n't like it , but i am stuck .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
i recommend for word processing and internet users .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O
ive never had a problem with it !####O O O O O O O O
however , they were kind enough to send a replacement free of charge .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
the feel of this is better than the toshiba , too .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
its fast , has high definition quality in the videos .####O B-OP O O B-OP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
but when i received my replacement , i made both recovery dvds ( 4 ) , and a driver/application dvd .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

i was originally concerned that i could n't view work i had done in college on my mac because of the pc formatting , but i was even more thrilled to learn of programs like ilife and iwork that allow you to convert your pc documents into readable files on macs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the macbook pro is a great product which can meet the needs of the average consumer .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O

turns out this is a common problem .####O O O O O O O O
to those thinking about switching , do it and do not look back !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
long story short , since i experience so many problems with my laptop every since i bought it from day one , i did n't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what i pay for a crappy laptop , but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year , they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services , they finally gave in .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

if you want more information on macs i suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

all in all , a very disappointing experience except that i learned how good the geek squad is and also customer service .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
they sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer , they paid postage and whatnot , but when i got my computer back it still was n't running right , and now my cd drive was n't reading anything !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
however , the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary ( unless you 're gaming ) .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O
their products , including the mbp , are beautiful , sleek and clever .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O

i have been a pc user since middle school , but in my mid twenties i decided to convert to the dark side , or should i say the brighter side of life .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and then , a guy came out to serve me instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O

i know that everyone thinks macs are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial expense you 'll find that they 're worth every penny ( besides , there 's always the financing plan that best buy offers ) .####O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it was n't worth it .####O O O B-OP O O
when the buyer returned it wal mart just boxed it , taped it shut resold it as new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

and at one point , they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when i upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop ( i bought the memory stick they recomended ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O

so then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back , but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened , and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair ( the price of a new one ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
this is what they told me : it heats up , and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops , and simply categorize them as portables .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a laugh too !####O O O O O O

if you faintly come close to touching this thing while typing , all craziness may break loose .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the new mbp offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this computer literally takes about five minutes to start up and to be able to use without it crawling and i do mean crawling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this laptop is great for work and doing my pictures .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
after talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate , i chose the macbook pro over the white macbook .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
but the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24/7 .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
so we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it did n't work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i bought this last week , and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch mouse stopped responding .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O

if a website ever freezes ( which is rare ) , its really easy to force quit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O
it was just one problem after another for me , and that 's reason we had forked out so much money was so we would n't have anything to worry about .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O

it was at my door in less than 24 hours .####O O O O O O O O O O O

the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and windows 7 works like a charm .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O

pretty much made sense to get a mini .####O O O O O O O O O
i could n't afford a new mac , so i bought a pc instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

bought from wal-mart , i believe that this laptop was a repaired item .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
