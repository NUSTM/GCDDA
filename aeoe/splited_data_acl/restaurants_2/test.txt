took my mom for mother 's day , and the maitre d' was pretty rude .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and service overcompensate .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O
i loving bringing friends here - and i do so every chance i get .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

do n't miss bloom 's on your next trip to manhatten .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
the staff is n't the friendliest or most competent , and i am stickler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think this is one of the more underrated places in the city .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
food was very good , but not what i would consider out of this world .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
restaurant snobs need not bother , this is a small , neighborhood kind of place .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
really depends on your luck !####O O O O O O
stepping into casa la femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in new york !####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
even better , they know how to cook french classics like steak au poivre and onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
if you were there when it first opened , give this restaurant a second chance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i noted it was crossed off on the bill .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
even with the prix fixe pricing , this restaurant is not worth it .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
just do n't do it .####O O O O O O
it 's delicious !####O O O O
the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there 's candlelight and music .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
they have an excellent selection ( the rolls with crab are really great ) .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
need i say more ?####O O O O O
we recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since i had my yorkie with me .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the have a great cocktail with citrus vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for !####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O
it can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order , but once the food is ordered , you are in for a treat .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine ... but not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
while it was large and a bit noisy , the drinks were fantastic , and the food was superb .####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
definitely highly not recommended .####O O O B-OP O
i only have friends .####O O O O O
they charge $ 6.00 for rice .####O O O O O B-ASP O
a great place to meet up for some food and drinks ...####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
lives up to the hype####O O O O O
amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings !!!####B-OP B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O
even if the food was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
feels like family when we go there .####O O O O O O O O
the potato balls were not dry at all ... in fact it was buttery .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O
the atmosphere is much better than sripraphai ( more modern and sleek ) .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
at peak times , the restaurant is overcrowded and tables are uncomfortably close .####O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
while this is n't classical restaurant fare , the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs .####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
but when we looked at the menu , there were n't a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large menu of japanese classic cuisine .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
all the nyu students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O
it was pleasantly uncrowded , the service was delightful , the garden adorable , the food ( from appetizers to entrees ) was delectable .####O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i got the $ 10 10-piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
i do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is also extremely well priced .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
service is average .####B-ASP O B-OP O
visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews .####O O O O O O O O O O
patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
the place 's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
i will be going back and heartily recommend it !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the omlette for brunch is great ...####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
there is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
by dinner time , they turn it around and mount a huge comeback !!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the atmosphere is great !!!####O B-ASP O B-OP O
we could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O

arigato gozimas yuka !####O O O O
this place is not inviting and the food is totally weird .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
if you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service , this is the place .####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
the food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive ( considering we were the only ones there for the first hour ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in an effort to increase turnover , the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
( besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
not worth it .####O O O O

i honestly do n't even know where to begin .####O O O O O O O O O O
the pizza and wine were excellent - the service too -- but what really made this place was the backyard dining area .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
food - awesome .####B-ASP O B-OP O
the pizza 's are made fresh , crispy , and ready to serve .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
every time in new york i make it a point to visit restaurant saul on smith street .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
after dinner , take your date to the huge dance floor , probably one of the biggest you 'll see in ny .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O

they are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O
i found it on a cold night , the perfect spot to warm up .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
atmosphere is a bore .####B-ASP O O O O
the food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , i do n't like being cramp in a corner .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
growing up in ny , i have eaten my share of bagels .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

okay , so i never write but there does n't seem to fair balance of positive to negative reviews concerning green bo and it 's time to speak up - i live in chinatown .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i completely recommend casa la femme for any special occasion and to really impress your date .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i ca n't believe people complain about no cheese sticks ?####O O O O O O O O O O O
excellent sashimi , and the millennium roll is beyond delicious .####B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
food is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the food was delicious ( i had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top-notch .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
after a seafood craving , i checked citysearch and chose to go to fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
out of the hundreds of italian restaurants in queens , this is among the best .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they do n't skimp .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
what more could you want ?####O O O O O O
frankly , when you compare what you can have here for lunch , versus mcds or so many other sandwich shops in the city , there is no comparison .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
try the pad thai , it 's fabulous and their prices are so cheap !####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
just because it 's cheap does not mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , it is great !####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
sure , the setting is nice .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
while the $ 20 entree range is not overly expensive , in new york city , there is definitely better food in that range , and so sapphire , despite it 's lovely atmosphere , will most likely not be a restaurant to which i will return .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have eaten at saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
nothing against a good sales call , but the tactics at amma are just too obvious .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
while it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the soup for the udon was soy sauce and water .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
too large for just two people but nothing was left .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i 've had the lunch buffet at chennai a couple of times , when i have been in the neighborhood .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce ( even its low sodium ) , the vinegar-soaked rice , and the scallion on top of the fish .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O

the food was good too .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O

not only would i not recommend jimmy 's restaurants to friends , i would strongly suggest they go anywhere but .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and i hate to say this but i doubt i 'll ever go back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
try the times square cocktail -- ginger lemonade with vodka ( also available without vodka . )####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
but now that it 's under new ownership and has been renovated , it looks great .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the service is pretty good .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the side dishes were passable , and i did get a refill upon request .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O

i love the drinks , esp lychee martini , and the food is also very good .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
its good to go there for drinks if you do n't want to get drunk because you 'll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the service is so bad .####O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O

quick and friendly service .####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
i sometimes see the waiters do n't have enough knowledge of their dishes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one of us actually liked the expresso - that 's it .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
decor is nice though service can be spotty .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O
try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and that 's no mean feat ...####O O O O O O O
again , i 'd be super upset if that were my employee .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the staff was so horrible to us .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O
price no more than a jersey deli but way better .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O
food is usually very good , though ocasionally i wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
when i arrived at orsay i was thrown back , in a veyr good sense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
please save yourself the frustration .####O O O O O O

although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP B-ASP O O O
in reality ( to maximize potential diners ) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
they could n't even make a salad that was appealing .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O

it took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
however , service was as plain as sesame crusted salmon i had .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O

the food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over-bearing or rushed .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP O
my friend is 100 % right in the experience we had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O

not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate decor will make you feel like you ’re no longer in the city .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the banana pudding they serve has never seen an oven , the crabcakes are way over salted and do n't get me started on the very greasy mac and cheese .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

we thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i had the salmon dish and while it was fine , for the price paid , i expected it to have some type of flavor .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
my gf 's duck confitte was very solid as well , although i have little base of reference .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O

you do n't go to mizu for excellent service , you go for the large amounts of food , the amiable atmosphere , and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O

the food is great and the prices are reasonable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
the atmosphere is n't the greatest , but i suppose that 's how they keep the prices down .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the price is reasonable although the service is poor .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
we both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP O
it 's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic , even .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O
also , if you do n't want to sit at a certain table , you do n't have to !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
if you go for the pre-theatre menu , it 's an even greater deal .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
i highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O
they had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice - result - we had large chunks of burnt rice in our serving bowl .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O

my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

at 5 dumplings for $ 1 , you just can not go wrong .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but they 've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the godmother pizza ( a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual ) .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O

it takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something ( although they dont forget to charge you for it .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
the food was not very tasty , the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O

i was n't impressed and it was n't spicey ????####O O O B-OP O O O O O O

the octopus eaters were floored by the octopus salad .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
