i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O

if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
we ate outside at haru 's sake bar because haru 's restaurant next door was overflowing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the ambience is pretty and nice for conversation , so a casual lunch here would probably be best .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
last time i went here , the waitress did n't come back after taking our order .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i plan on stopping by next week as well .####O O O O O O O O O O
what a great place !####O O B-OP B-ASP O
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost !####B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the first time the sushi was outstanding , the second time it was a little bland .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
thius is a must for anyone who loves shabu-shabu .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
a different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .####O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
this is the perfect date spot for williamsburg couples .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the hot dogs are top notch , and they 're slamwich is amazing !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i have to agree with the previous reviewer .####O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend jewel bako if you want to feel like you were kicked in the groin and had to pay for it too .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything is always cooked to perfection , the service is excellent , the decor cool and understated .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP O
not cheap , but not that expensive either .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
my only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do not try unless you 're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
buon appetito !####O O O
the food is so cheap and the waiters are nice .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O

if i could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza , sorry - not the best in nyc .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
the deco and ambiance was really romantic .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O
a cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
overall , a solid restaurant and at less than $ 40pp ( including wine ) , a solid deal as well .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
alias is warm and cozy and you do n't get that squished-in feeling you get at 71 clinton .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

poor service and management####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP
the atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd , but there were a few groups of mid 20 's / 30 year olds also .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you are treated just like royality .####O O O O O O O
the only thing more wonderful than the food ( which is exceptional ) is the service .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface , and you get platters of thin sliced meats , various vegetables , and rice and glass noodles .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
we were there march 7 and found maison very nice .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

the corned beef and pastrami are excellent , much less fatty than those big tourist places around times square .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
not the typical nyc gimmick theme restaurant .####O O B-OP O O O O O

great wine list ( italian ) , good food , service was initially fine .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the place does get crowded , so i recommend going between 4-5 pm .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O
conveniently located too , being right on bedford ave.####O O O O O O O O O
the location is perfect .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one !####O O O O O O O O O O O
not a typical pizza joint , but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-OP O O B-ASP O
once you step into cosette , you 're miraculously in a small , off-the-beaten path parisian bistro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

a wonderful place !####O B-OP B-ASP O
everything we had was pretty good , but we have only been there once .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
this is a real gem of a place .####O O O O O O O O O
i had a late dinner at lucky stike , a great name for a joint if ever i saw one .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i had the salmon dish and while it was fine , for the price paid , i expected it to have some type of flavor .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i would highly recommend nina 's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
the two waitress 's looked like they had been sucking on lemons .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
we shared a bottle of sake , an order of edamames , and she had the sushi plate while i had the sashimi .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
overall i would recommend it and go back again .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
glechik might be way too tiny for a restaurant by russian standards , but it is cozy and the food is simply great .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the side dishes were passable , and i did get a refill upon request .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
get the pepperoni - yum - and a family style salad .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
but the pizza is way to expensive .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
fabulous decor - makes you feel like you 're in a trendy manhattan restaurant , very very good food , cheaply-priced , generally friendly staff , and if you 're a manhattanite , or spend most of your time in manhattan , rice avenue will make you feel at home ..... very soho/village/upper west side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele ..... all on roosevelt avenue !####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

compared to ess-a , tal offers a less doughy bagel !####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O

we also had shared a house salad that was fresh .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
as a fan of thai , i have tried quite a few different restaurants in nyc and this one was definitely the worst .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we left after one drink .####O O O O B-ASP O
of course this atmosphere is lacking , but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways ?####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
if you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O

even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine , if you can call $ 70.00 inexpensive , the cost is through the roof for better than average fare .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O

the decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 frickin hours to come !!!!####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O

though the spider roll may look like a challenge to eat , with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll , it is well worth the price you pay for them .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O O O

while sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any indian restaurant i have been to in new york city , the food was not what i had hoped for .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O

traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O

great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer .####B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
it is also extremely well priced .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the food was definitely good , but when all was said and done , i just could n't justify it for the price ( including 2 drinks , $ 100/person ) ...####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the service is ok , some of the people did n't get what they asked for .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i have never eaten in the restaurant , however , upon reading the reviews i got take out last week .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
okay-i do n't mind the oily part ( cause most are cooked that way ) but it was way too bland .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but trust me it is so worth it .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
as we were leaving , the couple standing by the door said to another waiter , we 're not in a hurry .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
subtle food and service####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP
the tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
i 've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine , if not good .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
skip this restaurant , it 's a big disappointment .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the manager then told us we could order from whatever menu we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the waiter and the resturant that we let and went some place else .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O

i really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi on saffron risotto .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
if you are in the area try the bagel shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd ave.####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O

the atmosphere is relaxed and casual .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
i would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i am reluctant to write because i would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
only complaint would be that at an average cost of $ 12 - $ 15 per meal , i 'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat !####O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O
as we waited i watched 3 seperate groups of diners discuss how dissapointed they also were .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
in fact , this was not a nicoise salad and was barely eatable .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O
while the room is not particularly comfortable , once you 're seated you 'll forget about everything except what 's on your plate .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
food is great .####B-ASP O B-OP O

gigino 's in wagner park is so enjoyable .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
since it literally is a complete hole in the wall , it 's a bit intimidating at first , but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - do n't hesitate to ask for help with what to get .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O

however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
