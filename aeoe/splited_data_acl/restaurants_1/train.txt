well , this place is so ghetto its not even funny .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in an area sadly lacking in decent thai food , this is one of the best spots .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O
their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
the pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n't even fully melted !####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
it can not be the ambience , because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

this was the worst dining experience i 've ever had .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O

what more could you want ?####O O O O O O
they are served on focacchia bread and are to die for .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O
turned out there was full service upstairs and sat down .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O

whatever the reason it is definitely the place to be .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the waiter was attentive .####O B-ASP O B-OP O

the food was extremely tasty , creatively presented and the wine excellent .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O
appetizer are excellent here ; you can make a great ( and inexpensive ) meal out of them .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O
the manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a cozy place to go with a couple of friends .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O

the hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
if you live in upper manhattan , siam square is the place for thia food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
in fact , while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu , and i could n't help telling them that the food was horrible .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
highly recommended to all !####O B-OP O O O
kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the uws !####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
everything we had was good or ok .... but definitely nothing great .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
for sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this restaurant deserves .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O

i loved it .####O B-OP O O
authentic korean food lovers should visit 32nd street , of course .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out .####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
however , being foodies , we were utterly disappointed with the food .####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O
please take my advice , go and try this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O
good crowd , good outdoor seating , with a hip japanese vibe .####B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the only drawback is that it 's a little pricey .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
the food is yummy , especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
we all ate pasta entre'es , which were great .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
one of my fav spots in the city .####O O O O O O O O O
they did n't disappoint , service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
it 's delicious !####O O B-OP O
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience ) .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i highly reccomend the grand marnier shrimp , it 's insanely good .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
just go to yamato and order the red dragon roll .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
limited menu , no-so-fresh ingredients , thinly-sliced fish , fall-apart rice .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the service was superb , they treat you like family .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
check out the secret back room .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
since i was in the neighborhood , we made sure to give this a try .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we ended up having to just leave because we were essentially being ignored by the wait staff -- even though the rest of the restaurant was largely empty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
while the place is not a hotspot hangout , the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
you must try the garlic soup !####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the restaraurant is very small so reservations are a must .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O
do not get the go go hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
this is the only thai place i go too in nyc , it 's wonderful , and live relaxed jazz on certain nights .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
both were very good , but nothing you could n't get at similar restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
really , i find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds -- this , in the city of a million restaurants , at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can not recommend og more highly if i tried - check it out for yourself .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food , served in small tasting portions ( as an option ) is very good with each dish being better than the next .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
the wine list is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
worth a visit .####B-OP O O O
i would definitely come back to this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O
the wait staff was loud and inconsiderate .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
the restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
great hot dogs !####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i loved it and would highly recommend .####O O O O O O O O
this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
try the sea bass .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the absolute worst service i 've ever experienced and the food was below average ( when they actually gave people the meals they ordered ) .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i can understand the prices if it served better food , like some chinese restaurants in midtown/uptown area .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i 've been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
if you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo .####O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this place is average ... at best .####O O O B-OP O O O O
this place has beautiful sushi , and it 's delicious cheap .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-OP O
perhaps the last reviewer ( who stated she was treated with attitude ) lives in a parallel universe because i have never had anything but a perfect experience at yasuda .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
this place must have cost the owners afortune to build .####O O O O O O O O O O O
none of that yucky whipped stuff .####O O O O O O O
rude service , medicore food ... there are tons of restaurants in ny ... stay away from this one####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is great and the environment is even better .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it 's a very disappointing experience .####O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i just do not understand what the fuss is all about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
a cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that i will never go back .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
best of all is the warm vibe , the owner is super friendly and service is fast .####B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
i think the stuff was better than disney .####O O O O O O O O O
the only fallback on this restaurant is the prices .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
highly recommended ... as stated , i have n't dined * in * the restaurant but stopped by there to pick up takeout and it seems a very relaxing place ; also , the bar looks nice .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
this was the perfect quiet , relaxing , and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater .####O O O B-OP B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
( besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for starters they delivered us someone else 's order .####O O O O O O O O O O
obviously run by folks who know a pie .####O O O O O O O O O
for an untrendy rip-off - eat here .####O O B-OP O O O O O
i ca n't remember the last time i had such gross food in new york .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
probably would not go again ...####O O O O O O
terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n't fresh .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O
saul is the best restaurant on smith street and in brooklyn .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O

i would recommend this place to anyone and would without a doubt come again .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
we recently spent new year 's eve at the restaurant , and had a great experience , from the wine to the dessert menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in - quite a weird selection .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O
an excellent choice in midtown .####O B-OP O O O O
but the service was a bit slow .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
somewhat pricey but what the heck .####O B-OP O O O O O
personally i like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
the atmosphere is great !!!####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee rice porridge .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the service was attentive , yet unimposing , the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
fresh , mind blowing flavors .####O O O O O O
my chicken was completely dried out and on the cold side and the sauce was not very flavorful .####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
rao is a good restaurant , but it 's nothing special .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
are you freaking kidding me ?####O O O O O O
this was a great surprise .####O O O O O O
yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
frankly , when you compare what you can have here for lunch , versus mcds or so many other sandwich shops in the city , there is no comparison .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well !####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O
my gf and i dine at bukhara often as she lives near it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my party had the bbe fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake !####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
odd for ave b , not just odd , the place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least .####B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i recommend their pad see ew , pork chops or tofu plates .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O

only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is a great bargain .####O O O O B-OP O O
we had the most wonderful waitress .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it 's just good food , nothing more and that 's all we want !####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
they are tasty , but i suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average american digestive system .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , it 's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O

all pretty good .####O O B-OP O
from the entrees to the sides to the drinks , everything was creatively prepared yet still simple .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-OP O
their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything about this restaurant was special .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the pizza and wine were excellent - the service too -- but what really made this place was the backyard dining area .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the waitstaff is solicitous and friendly and always seems glad to see us , and the food is wonderful , if not stunningly creative .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
all of the apetizers are good and the sangria is very good .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O

this place is always very crowded and popular .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O

bring your date and a bottle of wine !####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the floor was wet , the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor , no soap , and no hand towels left .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all i can say is $ 2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you 'll find in the city , though the quality is some of the best .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
by the time we were done , it was past 1:00 am .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not recommend the heartland brewery .####O O O B-OP O O O O
everything about this place is adorable - even the bathroom !####O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
i guess the way my friends and i described it was the french colonies .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the cold appetizer dishes taste like the way i remember them to taste when i was growing up in taiwan .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the main course had an average portion , and was decent overall .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
it is very overpriced and not very tasty .####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
yes , the prices are high , but i felt it was worth it .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
it 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it ( the sauce was translucent and red ) .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
just do n't take the seat between the bar and the back half of the restaurant , i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

if the weather is nice , try to snag an outside table .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $ 10 .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O
unfortunately , unless you live in the neighborhood , it 's not in a convenient location but is more like a hidden treasure .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
we 've lived in the area for more than 8 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my manhattan restaurant list .####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
authentic shanghai style and i can not recommend a better shanghai place in new york .####B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the service is friendly , if not the most prompt in the world , the food is great , and the prices , while not cheap , wo n't put your wallet out of commission .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
and it all comes at a very reasonable price ( congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3-6 each ) .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the last two times i ordered from here my food was soo spicy that i could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
all the various greek and cypriot dishes are excellent , but the gyro is the reason to come - if you do n't eat one your trip was wasted .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over-bearing or rushed .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
all of my co-workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they had n't heard about this place .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
what more can you ask for ?####O O O O O O O
i 've been here twice now .####O O O O O O O

the food is great and authentic .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O

i have dined at mammino several times now and each time it gets bettter .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
that 's good and bad .####O O B-OP O B-OP O

this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i 've been to naples 45 for dinner twice .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O

definitely something to come down and check out .####O O O O O O O O O

try the pad se-ew or chicken with cashew nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O
succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired ' doneness ' accompanied by salads and sides that do n't look like leafy road kill .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
the blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the service is great .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
they might be all business at the counter when you give your order , but their food says i love you .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
the exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O
spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey .####B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
we were disappointed with the pre-fixe menu of only 2 choices per course ( other restaurants offer 3 choices ) and ended up ordering a la carte .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

if you ' re in new york , you do not want to miss this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this restaurant is not worth the time , effort , or money to say the least .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i mentioned the squid dish was n't very good when the waitress visited .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this was n't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup , but i thought that was what made the place so special .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
we 've lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
and the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i have been to casimir over 5 times and i have always had a great time there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O

for asian fusion , there are many places further downtown .####O O O O O O O O O O O
for many people , this may not seem like aunthentic thai food because most places in nyc arent quite authentic .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
we wo n't go to this place again for a good meal .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O

both times we waited well over a half hour for a table ( even though we had reservations ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O
the manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
when i got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am french and i really felt like home !!!####O O O O O O O O O O
ca n't argue about that , but they are clearly over priced .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
our waiter was horrible ; so rude and disinterested .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O B-OP O
we could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
butter was melted , white wine warm , cheese oozing everywhere .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O
it 's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are other vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's super-trendy and there 's always someone to take that empty seat , so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
if your visiting , you 'll enjoy the ambiance and the fact that it 's in time sq. . .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O

myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the city ; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i am going to the mid town location next .####O O O O O O O O O O

while the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and service could have been a lot better .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
it is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O

the in-house lady dj on saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
still , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ...####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
service was devine , oysters where a sensual as they come , and the price ca n't be beat !!!####B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
food is usually very good , though ocasionally i wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O

even upon delivery , their juicy pork buns are quite good . .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
at first i was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of nyc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will be going back and heartily recommend it !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
food was decent , but not great .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O

for 7 years they have put out the most tasty , most delicious food and kept it that way ...####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
still stay away , the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer ...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O

i have eaten here a handful of times , for no reason besides sheer convenience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service is ok , some of the people did n't get what they asked for .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
perhaps it was an off night , but it was suprisingly average for a 9.3 rating .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
great pizza for lunch place .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O
we love th pink pony .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
after passing by this restaurant for sometime i finally decided to go in and have dinner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
still , try it once , since if you end up loving the food , it could be one of your best dining experiences .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
even the pasta is delicious here ( a rarity in new york pizza restaurants ) .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
food does n't appear to be cooked on premisis but there 's a high turnover so its pretty fresh .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O
try the pad thai , or sample anything on the appetizer menu ... they 're all delicious .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the bar drinks were eh , ok to say the least .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O

everything about this place was wonderful .####O O O O O B-OP O
the best dessert , a chocolate and peanut butter tart , is n't particularly hawaiian , but it 's a small world when it comes to sweets .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
went last thursday .####O O O O

i have been twice to this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O
tasty steak , pork loin , the works .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
much of the time it seems like they do not care about you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger , made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas , carrots and other vegetables and spices .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the halibut was too salty , dessert was so so ( do n't waste any of your calories ) and service was poor .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
in the end you end up with a fair tab and nothing but a great time !!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .####B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O

after 2 tries by the waiter to take it away ( we had n't even looked at it yet , we had full beers yet to drink ) , the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

was n't going to share but i feel obligated ... while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this place is cool enough to be in the east village , but french enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in paris .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i love their spicy scallop roll , and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken .####O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i went there 2times .####O O O O O
now we moved out of the state and every visit to nyc includes a stop here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've been frequenting the tasting room since it first arrived in the east village and i 've never been disappointed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
bill a little high , but worth it .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O
the menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
we were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
give it a try , menu is typical french but varied .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O

i went here with my boyfriend and another couple .####O O O O O O O O O O
the food was excellent as well as service , however , i left the four seasons very dissappointed .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
a great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from costco and sell it right outside for only $ 2.50 .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
the food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

this guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O

ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food was almost always excellent .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O

the menu is nothing like the one on the website .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
they forgot a sandwich , did n't include plastic forks , and did n't include pita with the hummus platter .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O

among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants , this offers by far one of the best values for your money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we 'd go back again####O O O O O
but on a lazy saturday night , we ended up going .####O O O O O O O O O O O O

however , it 's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
most of the booths allow you to sit next to each other without looking like ' that ' couple .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the price , you can not eat this well in manhattan .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken ( usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats ) .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O

the menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger , to steak , to escargot .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
so , for good food i 'd recommend it , but not for a fun night out .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
when my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

good for a quick sushi lunch .####B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
try it !####O O O

the dim sum here is only so-so .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
to begin , we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave , when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
however , for what we spent , overall , it just was not up to par .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everytime i decide to try another place on the ues , i get angry that i did n't just go to zucchero pomodori .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and service overcompensate .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O

the food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n't like .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
that is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish , and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the garlic mashed potatoes are hands down the best in the city !####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O

i just read mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond .####O O O O O O O O O O O O

most importantly , food is excellent .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O

it 's only $ 1.95 for a regular slice and $ 4.00 for a slice with a mushroom , not mushrooms .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in conclusion , this place sucks !!!####O O O O O B-OP O
much of the time it seems like they do not care about you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for chinatown ) alternative .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O

the waiters are sweet , the food is tasty and the bill is never too large .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
they do n't walk around with the trays of dim sum .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
be sure to accompany your food with one of their fresh juice concoctions .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-ASP I-ASP O
i have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which i would expect at a upscale indian restaurant but this place does n't have an upscale feel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O

this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced wine list .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP B-ASP I-ASP O

i understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O

how can they survive serving mediocre food at exorbitant prices ?!####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
from the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that i ca n't remember because of the fabulous cakebread cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O

sometimes you pay a lot and do n't get much in return - it 's manhattan , things are expensive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
worth visiting the 1st ave spot because it is the original store .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service is always bad though , do n't expect much of anything from your server , and i would not recommend bringing a date here either .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
although the restaurant itself is nice , i prefer not to go for the food .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

obviously the chinese translation of this place does not mean big wong , it actually means great prosperity .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
still , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ...####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
the servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait ( shortly i might add ) .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

then , if they answer the phone , you 're lucky if they do n't hang up on you !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in reality ( to maximize potential diners ) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
try green curry with vegetables .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

yet paired with such rude service , would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
there is a downside if you 're ordering in -- the delivery guys have major attitude .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
i asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if i like uni . (####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the noodle and rices dishes taste great .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O

i tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O

the service varys from day to day - sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
we could only get through an appetizer and cheese fondue .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
if you 're in town , it 's worth searching for another place .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
i thought the food is n't cheap at all compared to chinatown .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O

would have rather tried terrace in the sky or water club for that price####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP

if you want to dine with large party , i recommend to make reservation basement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O

i 'm sure i 'll return for a final judgement tho .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is all-around good , with the rolls usually excellent and the sushi/sashimi not quite on the same level .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
creative , consistent , fresh .####O O O O O O
your money could easily be better spent elsewhere ( anywhere ) .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O

great idea and base for restaurant , but work on the details , people who think this was good need to go back to the shore towns and rethink what it should have tasted like .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i 've been to sotto voce several time , and i have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the thai section of the menu but nothing we got was thai .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O

need i say more ?####O O O O O
the food was good .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i was back-to-back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a very nice surprise .####O O O O B-OP O O
seriously , this place kicks ass .####O O O O O O O
i would highly recommand requesting a table by the window .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
we did notice however , that some tables had what looked like pita instead of naan .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
from the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
( always ask the bartender for the seasonal beer !!!####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
took my mom for mother 's day , and the maitre d' was pretty rude .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O

the lamb meat was under-cooked and extrmely chewy .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
the steak was excellent and one of the best i have had ( i tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O
but , they were too big for the bun .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
dessert is a joke ... dont bother####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O
very romantic fires - i 've literally spent hours at lanterna , drinking wine from their extensive wine and enjoying the ambience .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O
we would return to this place again !####O O O O O O O O
so , i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
in about 12 minutes , the thing is gone .####O O O O O O O O O O
great food and the prices are very reasonable .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the ambience is pretty and nice for conversation , so a casual lunch here would probably be best .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
you can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip , and the food was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them .####O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did ' nt feel like finishing them .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got hair in my food 2 times of then !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
it is one the nicest outdoor restaurants i have ever seen in ny -- i am from italy and this place rivals the ones in my country .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we usually go to the chart house to celebrate a birthday or anniversary .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend reservations on weekends though .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
overall , worht every penny .####O O O O O O
we went there , no one greeted us .####O O O O O O O O O
as bfc does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

no one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
and forget what you read under me , the atmosphere is n't that bad either .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously , but it should n't .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the icing made this cake , it was fluffy , not ultra sweet , creamy and light .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP O B-OP O
great indian food and the service is incredible .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
a little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O
anyway , the owner was fake .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
ok , so the servers wander around a little clueless , but there 's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it 's fine , you just have to make a small effort to get their attention .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

also , the sandwiches ( nearing $ 7 ) did n't come with anything like chips or a side .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everyone treats you like you were part of the family .####O O O O O O O O O O O
ambiance - relaxed and stylish .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
i asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere !####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally i 'd drink popcorn topping before i 'd eat another one of these .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
terrible experience .####B-OP O O

the food is very good , but not outstanding .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O

impressed ...####O O
the service , however , is a peg or two below the quality of food ( horrible bartenders ) , and the clientele , for the most part , are rowdy , loud-mouthed commuters ( this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff ) getting loaded for an ac/dc concert or a knicks game .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O

the dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally i 'd drink popcorn topping before i 'd eat another one of these .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambience was nice , but service was n't so great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
over time , the food quality has decreased substantially , it is a lot less crowded than it used to , and the service must definitely be part of the reason .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O

the anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

the food here was mediocre at best .####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
the food portions are really large .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O

now at the top of our list , del frisco 's steakhouse .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys ( masaman , green , red ) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it .####O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O

even better , they know how to cook french classics like steak au poivre and onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the food however , is what one might expect .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O

only complaint is the pricing -- i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
please do n't fool us .####O O O O O O

just bring someone who speaks cantonese because waiter may not understand you .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
for some reason , all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the salmon .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O

the dinner menu is diverse and top-notch as well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O
be careful of portions - they 're huge .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the food we ordered was excellent , although i would n't say the margaritas were anything to write home about .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
( 1 ) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of mott st. just south of bayard####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my wife and i went to orsay for valentine 's dinner .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i am surprised at the lower reviews because it is definitely better than other places i have tried with higher ratings .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
for instance , plates were just dumped on the table , i was handed the wine list upside down , etc. ...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
our server was very helpful and friendly .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
they did not have mayonnaise , forgot our toast , left out ingredients ( ie cheese in an omelet ) , below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the worst excuse for japanese food i 've ever encountered .####O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
it is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , do not pass it up .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
you ca n't say its cheap because food is cheaper in chinatown .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
the service was mediocre , and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
overall , not worth the money .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
gross food – wow####B-OP B-ASP O O
i ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-OP O
although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
my friends spoke so much about it for months , i finally made the time to come down ear and dine in .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am so coming back here again , as much as i can .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so much more than the usual bar food , go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP I-ASP O
my husbands was perfect , my was well done and dry .####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
coming from boston this place is like emma 's pizza in kendall square in cambridge ( although they have more funky toppings ! )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
the worst excuse for japanese food i 've ever encountered .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the food was actually aweful .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
slow service , but when you 're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20 , who really notices ?####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a must try !####O O O O
we ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it 's cool and the music is hear well there .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
i 'm almost tempted to give this place a bad review so i can keep the crowds away ... been going there on and off for a year now and it 's really my fave hang out in the city .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
our son loves pizza and we have a certified neapolitan pizzaria in our home city ( seattle ) , we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
leave the kids at home !####O O O O O O
we had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O
i had the best ravioli ever .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O

the service was quick and friendly .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O

there is a real gallery of stars that have visited .####O O O O O O O O O O O
too bad , has a lot of potential .####O B-OP O O O O O O O
so , again , give it a try .####O O O O O O O O O
it 's true , this place is not cheap .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
loved it !####B-OP O O
i was starving and the small portions were driving me crazy !####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O
we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and will be going back for the desserts ....####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
have recommended the place to friends , always gets good response .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O
rather than preparing vegetarian dish , the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables ( minus sauce , seasoning , or any form or aesthetic presentation ) .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all in all , the food was great ( except for the dessserts ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O
but when we looked at the menu , there were n't a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine ... but not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
siam square is fairly new to the neighborhood and i think in time will gain the recognition it deserves .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this made it obvious that the food was n't cooked fresh ; it was obviously made before hand and then reheated .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
$ 6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O
oh , and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough - yummy !####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
the crowd was older and the restaurant is very cramped , but it has old school charm .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
finally !####O O
if you want something really different than try jekyll and hyde .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
great bagels made the old-fashioned way .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
even though its good seafood , the prices are too high .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i 'd call it an ' italian dinner ' .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
the food is awesome - definitely try the striped bass .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

there is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the rice to fish ration was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
waiters tend to forget drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one entree .####B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
i go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

in such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch , this place is great .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
this restaurant was way overhyped .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the food has been consistant for years and it never lets you down .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
overall a disappointing experience for that price category .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O
