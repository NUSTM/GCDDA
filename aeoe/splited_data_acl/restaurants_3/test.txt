siam square is fairly new to the neighborhood and i think in time will gain the recognition it deserves .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the counter service is bad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O

fabulous decor - makes you feel like you 're in a trendy manhattan restaurant , very very good food , cheaply-priced , generally friendly staff , and if you 're a manhattanite , or spend most of your time in manhattan , rice avenue will make you feel at home ..... very soho/village/upper west side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele ..... all on roosevelt avenue !####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O
i would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the wait time .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

best italian food i ever had ( and being italian , that means alot ) .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the staff ignored my friends and i the entire time we were there .####O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
first off , the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her ( odd in a restaurant with 6 tables ) and got our order wrong .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
raga 's is a romantic , cozy restaurant .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O
even after they overcharged me the last time i was there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
you could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other french bistros .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hostess said " wow that 's a large group , unless you are n't together " , to which i replied " no we are , and there will be one more , so a table for six please . "####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant , and passing by it on a daily basis , we decided to try .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can eat gourmet food at a fast food price .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i have tried literally every restaurant on curry row .####O O O O O O O O O O

was surprisingly disappointed .####O O B-OP O
the service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing !####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants , this offers by far one of the best values for your money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
delicious crab cakes too .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
it 's a nice place to relax and have conversation .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O

our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5 pm and it was very crowded and noisy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O

we ordered our appetizers , i ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
wow ! how have i missed this one , tried long tan last week for the first time and now know what the ny times and many more in the neighborhood already knew .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the wine is always good , the tapas are always yummy , especially with the warm pita bread .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O

with the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
i really did n't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of grand central .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
planet thai is great !####O O O B-OP O
if you wrote a bad review , it 's because you do n't understand what rao 's is all about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
got club soda , filled with ice , no lime .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
not one to jump to complaints ( hence my lack of previous online reviewing ) , i called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the crowd was older and the restaurant is very cramped , but it has old school charm .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the waitstaffs are nice though .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O
i 'm no food critic , but i 'd like to think i have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in ny for the last 11 years .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and i can not comp it .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of new york .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
you 'll adore it .####O O B-OP O O
first walking in the place seemed to have great ambience .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
for the price you pay for the food here , you 'd expect it to be at least on par with other japanese restaurants .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we had fun eating in there , we were there like around 3 a.m. in the morning !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
ambiance is barely romantic but management tries .####B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O
and evaluated on those terms pastis is simply wonderful .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
good selection of wines ranging from affordable to high end .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
killer sushi !####B-OP B-ASP O
the happy hour is so cheap , but that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
when going out for a nice dinner , i like a nice ambiance as well as very good food .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
not the greatest sushi place , but excellent for a $ 19.95 all you can eat .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
one of us actually liked the expresso - that 's it .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
this is definitely an excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the night scene is more than alive .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce ( even its low sodium ) , the vinegar-soaked rice , and the scallion on top of the fish .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
no doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town , spirit and bateaux will be our destination .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food was great - sushi was good , but the cooked food amazed us .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O

the crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i 've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late , raucus dinner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a ' special ' bagel experience .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is a great bargain .####O O O O B-OP O O
just moved to the neighborhood and we 've been trying all the west village sushi restaurants .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i love their thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the must !####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O

we ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
we were n't even at our table for more than an hour total .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the portions are huge , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
sum it : local investment bankers like it , try for yourself at least once .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my first experience at siam square was very pleasant .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
given the incredible architecture surrounding it , this place has no character .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O
the food is delicious and highly recommended .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
i would have gotten some cole slaw and a knish if my stomach had more space .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the two waitress 's looked like they had been sucking on lemons .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it is not consistent .####O O O O O
although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O

for the people who want great food plus great service , roxy is a place to avoid !####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
authentic food and they have real service , not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door .####B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and amazingly cheap .####O O O O

there are so many other great places to go to eat and drink .... . this place is not worth it ...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
zero ambiance to boot .####B-OP B-ASP O O O

the buffet had a nice selection .####O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
when we notified him that he did n't mention the specials , he did n't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses !####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
granted the space is smaller than most , it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
we were on our way back to nj , and since i am in ny , we figured why not grab some food ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
not enough wines by the glass either .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O
definitely not worth the price !####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
it gets crowded at lunchtime but there are lots of seats in back and everyone who works there is so nice .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the environment is romantic , but the food is horrible , the service is pathetic , and gabriella lies about everything she could .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
so for a filling and healthy meal give it a go .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
but that was n't the icing on the cake : a tiramisu that resembled nothing i have ever had .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
whenever you need a sushi fix , mizu will be there with quality fish and great service .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
we have been to montparnasse many times and return often for good reason .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
it 's about $ 7 for lunch and they have take-out or dine-in .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the fillings may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
i went there after hearing how great it was .####O O O O O O O O O O
go here for the drinks !####O O O O B-ASP O
the prices are wonderfully low .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
the only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting , the additional menu items are only written in chinese .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
service is not what you are coming here for ...####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
from the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was was just fantastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O

but the best part about ls is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the bts .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
the food is surprisingly good , and the decor is nice .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O

the place is absolutely adorable and the food is delicious .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it helps if you know what to order .####O O O O O O O O O
once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
could have had better for 1/3 the price in chinatown .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
this is the pinnacle of indian fast food ( all fast foods in my opinion ) .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
my wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O
this place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the staff should be a bit more friendly .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
with the great variety on the menu , i eat here often and never get bored .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
service was good and so was the atmosphere .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
pizza was a little soggy .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
while the place is not a hotspot hangout , the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like balthazar etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food was good .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
when you add it all together , it just does n't seem worth it to me ... especially considering the prices .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
drinks way over priced .####B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
even the wine by the glass was good .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
you will find everything about trio to your liking !####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
waitstaff is great , very attentive .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
the waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service was on point - what else you would expect from a ritz ?####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

lunch came with pickels and slaw , no extra charge .####B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
so all i 'm trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant i 've ever been to .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
always popular , always full , always a wait .####O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
this big draw is the all you can sushi here for $ 19.95 !####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
we have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O

the one vegetarian entree ( abby 's treasure ) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had wintermelon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
overall , not worth the money .####O O O O O O O
the one up front will smile and say what can i get for you , brother ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you want good authentic thai this place is not the place to go .####O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the staff is 100 % italian and the food is as authentic as it gets .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O

the meat dishes were only so-so .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
and the tom kha soup was pathetic .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
in the end you end up with a fair tab and nothing but a great time !!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better !####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O

as we were leaving , the couple standing by the door said to another waiter , we 're not in a hurry .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
you have to increase the service a lot .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O
knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
the staff was the friendliest that have seen in new york .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
restaurant was dirty and unkempt .####O O B-OP O B-OP O

however , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
prices even outside of restaurant week were great .####B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O

we have been to this place many times , and always have great food , wine , and service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
better than the bagel shop on the corner , but not worth going out of your way for , in my opinion .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
( that is a must , but not every restaurant can do ... )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hurley 's is terrific !####O O O B-OP O

helpful service and average price per dish $ 10 .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O

the food however , is what one might expect .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
excellent tapas at great prices , romantic , small but not overly crowed , excellent####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP
the best part of the experience was knowing that the manager ( a bubbly , friendly young woman with a great smile ) truly cared about how we were doing .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
our first time in new york and we had to try a new york bagel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
although small , it has beautiful ambience , excellent food ( the catfish is delicious - if ya do n't mind it a lil salty ) and attentive service .####O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes , however be warned that the peter 's favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top , like a salad .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O

our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the catch is that you are charged extra for anything that you leave on your plate so do n't be a greedy pig !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for years , i thought tuscan cuisine was the best , but salvatore converted me to the hearty neapolitan fare on my first visit .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O

ravioli was good ... but i have to say that i found everything a bit overpriced .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seriously , this is the best all you can eat in town - as everyone says , the spicy tuna hand rolls are the best - have 4 of these , and you 've broken even .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O

we visited orsay during ny restaurant week and tried their $ 35 menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O

as a japanese native , i 've lived in the tristate area for over 8 years , but i was just so amazed at this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
this is an amazing place to try some roti rolls .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
its not curry in a slurry crap , and regular run of the mill food .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
easily the worst stir-fried squid i 've ever tasted .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good good and bad service .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
i 've been there a few times , and i usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
they even have a section in the menu called american chinese food !####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
my boyfriend and i recently had an early dinner at artisanal and was satisfied with our experience .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O

the menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger , to steak , to escargot .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
i highly recommend cafe st. bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful service .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
for $ 600 ( the most we have ever paid ) not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in hoboken .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal .####B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
i 'd call it an ' italian dinner ' .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
i was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i must say it 's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O
we order a bit of everything on the menu .####O O O O O O O O O O
i go back in line like three times on average until i ca n't walk anymore .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
all i can say is wow !####O O O O O B-OP O
i 've been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the kitchen however , is almost always slow .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
overall , not worth the money .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i found the food to be just as good as its owner , da silvano , just much less expensive .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
not only was the sushi fresh , they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy ( try the duck !####O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O

i love ess-a-bagel , but i live on the west side , so i often go to murray 's for convenience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the dishes came out around 5 minutes apart .####O O O O O O O O O
the management was less than accomodating .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
not a large place , but it 's cute and cozy .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
the fried calamari was even better !####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
salads are a delicious way to begin the meal .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
good food at the restaurant ( a bit expensive , but great if you want to impress your date ) .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
a little crowded but they move that line really fast !####O O O O O O O O O O O

also get the onion rings -- best we 've ever had .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O

the dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally i 'd drink popcorn topping before i 'd eat another one of these .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
as to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this was a great surprise .####O O O B-OP I-OP O
so what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
we love the food , drinks , and atmosphere !####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O

there 's another girl who i ca n't describe , she is about 5 ' 6 " with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're * really * talking about .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the music which is sometimes a little too heavy for my taste .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
the decor is really blah , and not at all hip or happening .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O

the production is a symphony , alot of fun to experience.the food sublime for the most part .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O

they were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior .####O O O O O O O O O O O

try the hot dogs too , they 're snappy and delicious .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
the crispy chicken was n't for us , though .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O

as we waited i watched 3 seperate groups of diners discuss how dissapointed they also were .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
the drinks are a saving grace , but service staff , please , get over yourselves .####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O

while there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich , katz 's has a charm about it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
try the sea bass .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O

this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie ( that do n’t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
we loved it and will go back !####O B-OP O O O O O O

the dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
unlike hh up the block , this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
the fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .####B-OP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
okay-i do n't mind the oily part ( cause most are cooked that way ) but it was way too bland .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
everything was going good until we got our meals .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
my only complaint might be the fortune cookies - i 've never had a cookie predict bad luck for me before i visited kar .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
we usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably priced and very tasty .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O

look i dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place ( please try someother places ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
whoever the jazz duo was , they were on point .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the kitchen however , is almost always slow .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
the atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd , but there were a few groups of mid 20 's / 30 year olds also .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you are in a big group , this place is perfect because it recomends sharing - they have lazy susans on most tables - even families can feel comfortable here .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers , other times , they 've skipped my order .####O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
all toppings are so fresh you 'd think they had their own vegetable garden and the crust is so perfect , that one actually thinks of how it was made .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did ' nt feel like finishing them .####O O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this restaurant was way overhyped .####O O O O B-OP O
this restaurant used to be our regular thursday night dinner location .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the location and ambience is ok but the food is what makes up for it .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O
the homage to india is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer , a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce , while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated , fresh take on sweet-and-sour .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP O O O O
definite go if you 're used to good indian restaurant food from abroad .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O
the bagel was huge .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
very popular style izakaya ( sake and small portion of sake-friendly dishes ) .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O
however , it just so happens that there 's an even more amazing place just down the street .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
will give it another chance before i write it off .####O O O O O O O O O O O
how is this palce still open ?####O O O B-ASP O O O
after the main course came , we did n't see our waiter for at least 40 minutes !####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
here 's to the fake fish tanks too ...####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
outstanding bagels , but you get what you pay for .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i came again weeks later with my boyfriend and again had a very nice experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
one of my favorite places in manhattan .####O O O O O O O O
we were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria , but facing away from the bar when we turned back around , the $ 2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
would never go back there .####O O O O O O

turned out there was full service upstairs and sat down .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
a great choice at any cost and a great deal .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O
it seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O
so i 've never actually been to m proper , but i 've had it delivered a few times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
no dress codes , no attitudes , plenty of comfort companionship , a great place to relax in an always busy midtown .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the seafood dynamite is also otherworldly .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
i live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of the pizza place at 3 am .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
they charge different prices all the time .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
in short the black sheep distinguishes itself from the midtown pub herd with a look that 's a mix of sports-bar butch and ornate kitsch .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
this tiny williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
kenny the owner is always there and he treats my family like we are part of his family .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i knew upon visiting nyc that i wanted to try an orginal deli .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
some baby pizzas get their wish .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
we arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a hearty two thumbs up !####O O O O O O
lloovve this place .####O O O O
i loved this place !!####O B-OP O B-ASP O
but nonetheless -- great spot , great food .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
just because it 's cheap does not mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , it is great !####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
if i could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza , sorry - not the best in nyc .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
the atmosphere was great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
everything about this place was wonderful .####O O O O O B-OP O
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
impressed ...####O O
great service , great food .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i went to this restaurant with a woman that i met recently .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
stick to the items the place does best , brisket , ribs , wings , cajun shrimp is good , not great .####O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
they are by far the best past in new york .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
three page wine menu , one page entree and horedevous .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the dinner was ok , nothing i would have again .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
after all that , they complained to me about the small tip .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
decor is minimalist and clean - nothing to distract or commend .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O
but $ 1 for each small piece ???####O O O O O O O O
the frankenstein show was the best .####O O O O O B-OP O
the restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it 's a perfect place to have a amazing indian food .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
it 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
i fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of bbq roast pork .####O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i went to areo on a sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends , and spent three enjoyable hours there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the service , however , is a peg or two below the quality of food ( horrible bartenders ) , and the clientele , for the most part , are rowdy , loud-mouthed commuters ( this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff ) getting loaded for an ac/dc concert or a knicks game .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy , crowded bar at dinnertime .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O
it 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its location is good and the fact that hutner college is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to suan again and again .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
my fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
especially liked chicken tikka and the naan , and the dals .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
not what i would expect for the price and prestige of this location .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
you 'll pay at least double at any other italian restaurant in the city , and most still do n't compare .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
three of us arrived for dinner about 5:30 on a week night without reservations .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
definitely worth the trip to battery park city !####O B-OP O O O O O O O
fantastic !####B-OP O
i have no idea why this restaurant is so often overlooked .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the fish was adequate , but inexpertly sliced .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O
the tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
it hits the spot every time####O O O O O O
big thumbs up !####O O O O
when family came in he gave them apps to test their palets , and then ordered for them .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
anyway , this is the last time i cross the williamsburg .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
next time , we would n't dare ordering anything else other than some simple asian appetizers and drinks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but i would n't wan na live there .####O O O O O O O O O
the rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
just not good at all .####O O O O O O
food was very good , but not what i would consider out of this world .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
the cream cheeses are out of this world and i love that coffee !!####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O

mussles and calamari were superb saturday evening .####B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
the place is a bit hidden away , but once you get there , it 's all worth it .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O O
just remember , the later you go , the longer you may have to wait .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what more can you ask for ?####O O O O O O O
the crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
from the terrible service , to the bland food , not to mention the unaccommodating managers , the overall experience was horrible .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
not too much so , but enough that there 's a great scene .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
and where does patis go wrong ; no where .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it 's a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , i thought it was just annoying .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O
will absolutely visit again .####O O O O O
