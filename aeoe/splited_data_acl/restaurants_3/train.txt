on a recent saturday night , i was with a group of 5 at the bread bar .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i actually gave patroon another chance before writing this , but the second visit was even worse .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and i would have rather eaten at a mcdonald 's than this joint .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O
the food was definitely good , but when all was said and done , i just could n't justify it for the price ( including 2 drinks , $ 100/person ) ...####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the falafal was rather over cooked and dried but the chicken was fine .####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O

eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it 's a very disappointing experience .####O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
this is one of the best comfort food places in the city .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

if you 're in the ' hood , definitely stop in .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
what more could you want ?####O O O O O O
try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call ow ley soh , a favorite and sweet tasting bread .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O
i like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O

we laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent tip , which was generous , i feel .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for chinatown ) alternative .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
this place has the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anywhere else , the prices would be 3x as high !####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the dishes are remarkably tasty and such a cozy and intimate place !####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
the food is good , but very expensive for the casualness of it .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O

our teenage kids love it , too .####O O O O O O O O

all in all , the food was great ( except for the dessserts ) .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O

this should have been done in a back room - away from customers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
service was good and food is wonderful .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
what is even better , is that the prices are very affordable as well , and the food is really good .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O

the food is usually good but it certainly is n't a relaxing place to go .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
also a little more expensive than your average bagel place .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O

for park avenue i expected so much more .####O O O O O O O O O

pizza and garlic knots are great as well , i order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick !####B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
filled with suits , though , so you never really feel terribly comfortable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

i have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which i would expect at a upscale indian restaurant but this place does n't have an upscale feel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O

the room is a little plain , but it 's difficult to make such a small place exciting and i would not suggest that as a reason not to go .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food was mediocre and the service was severely slow .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O

ca n’t believe how an expensive nyc restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O

you would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O

note that they do not serve beer , you must bring your own .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O

i would not recommend this place to anyone .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
at $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
too bad the food was n't of the same heritage .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O

yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
the pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

to top it all off . . the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i love their eggplant pizza , as well as their pastas !####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O

for dinner i had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
we waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
we picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we were n't sure what to expect .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

a narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters , a great deal of mess ( stacks of bottles , cans ) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O

in fact there is only one i 've tried that even compares ( shabu tatsu ) and even then i prefer dokebi .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

anyone who ever dined at a thai restaurant is in for a huge disappointment .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

only suggestion is that you skip the dessert , it was overpriced and fell short on taste .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
we ended up having to just leave because we were essentially being ignored by the wait staff -- even though the rest of the restaurant was largely empty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O

it is set far from the small street it 's on , and there is no traffic noise .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

it 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the chefs .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O

the lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O

my friend had a burger and i had these wonderful blueberry pancakes .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
if you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you 'll love it here .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O
the food was authentic .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the prix fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough ( both in quantity and quality ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
service was awful - mostly because staff were overwhelmed on a saturday night .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
the only drawback is that it 's a little pricey .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
top spot in town for vietnamese classics , better than places that cost a lot more .####B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
everything from the eggs benedict to the mussels and even the hamburger were done well and very tasty .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O
if you live in new york city , you 'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the food is great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i recommend the black roasted codfish , it was the best dish of the evening .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i 've eaten at many different indian restaurants .####O O O O O O O O O
and the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP I-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
skip baroanda down the street ( eurotrashy , snooty and expensive ) and check this place out !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
tends to turn people away .####O O O O O O
i recommend the garlic shrimp , okra ( bindi ) , and anything with lamb .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
when we threatened to leave , we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it only took about five or so minutes to get an empty table , but standing up was n't too bad .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
while their kitchen food is delicious , their sushi is out of this world .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O

highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night i had !####O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
maybe it was the great company ( i had friends visiting from philly – yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but i just ca n’t say enough good things about this brasserie .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
the foie gras was sweet and luscious .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
culinaria is a welcome addition to the garment district - far better than any restaurant in the area .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the pizza was pretty good and huge .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
we were then shooed inside .####O O O O O O

this place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sure enough , exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
hey , i think $ 2 + for a 5 block walk ai n't bad .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
have never had a problem with service save a missing rice once .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
the halibut was too salty , dessert was so so ( do n't waste any of your calories ) and service was poor .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
if celebrities make you sweat , then your in for a ride , but if your like most around these parts then you 'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
after reading the posts , i was always skeptical to go to the minnow , despite living in park slope .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also ordered the change mojito , which was out of this world .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O

i just do not understand what the fuss is all about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh yes , and they lie on the phone , claiming they have seating in the garden , then of course the seats are not available .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O

i must say the view of nyc is so beautiful !####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
saul is pretty good , but definitely not great .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
although the restaurant itself is nice , i prefer not to go for the food .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
its a go-to for dates as well as entertaining out of town guests .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
try the ribs , sizzling beef and couple it with coconut rice .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car ( i happen to live in inwood ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am so coming back here again , as much as i can .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the bruschetta and panini 's are so yummy !####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i grew up on these bagels .####O O O O O B-ASP O
i love the little pie company as much as anyone else who has written reviews , but must discourage anyone from visiting the grand central location due to their rude service from two sales people .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the wine list is n't great , and the desserts are shipped in from bruno 's down the street , which is not as good as it used to be .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
stay far away from this place .####O O O O O O O
it was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap ( undercooked ) beef .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
good cake but : it was not the best cake i 've ever had , and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O

i 've had my fair share of modern japanese and this spot delivers .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
ask for the round corner table next to the large window .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
their twist on pizza is heatlhy , but full of flavor .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O

delicious bagels , especially when right out of the oven .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
probably would not go back here .####O O O O O O O
worth visiting the 1st ave spot because it is the original store .####B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
also , specify if you like your food spicy - its rather bland if you do n't .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
and $ 11 for a plate of bland guacamole ?####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i think the stuff was better than disney .####O O O O O O O O O
food is great and inexpensive .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O

we 've been following chef lyle 's food around new york for 15 years and while remaining classic , his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O

the entire dining experience was wonderful !####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the worst excuse for japanese food i 've ever encountered .####O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i would recommend roxy 's for that , but not for their food .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
even though its good seafood , the prices are too high .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O

the ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it 's a great find in astoria .####O O O B-OP O O O O
the sushi is average and the prices are anything but .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O

go here for the drinks !####O O O O B-ASP O

that is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish , and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
definitely will be back !####O O O O O

as a student in nyu i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
edible but really a ripoff at those prices given whats in the area .####B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
however , i think jeckll and hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O

service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique-seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
two words : free wine .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O

the prices were cheap compared to the quality of service and food .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
not the food , not the ambiance , not the service , i agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this is a great place to take out-of-towners , and perfect for watching the sunset .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
a gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but i 've experienced the same with other restaurants so i do n't appreciate such practice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
staffs are not that friendly , but the taste covers all .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O

go to any corned indian restaurant , and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
good , because hey , it 's more food , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap .####B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O

the food portions are really large .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
the food is amazing ... especially if you get the chef 's tasting menu and your favourite bottle ( or two ! ) of wine from an extensive selection of wines .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

the tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
fine dining restaurant quality .####B-OP O O B-ASP O
we actually left hungry and went across the street to wo hop at 15 mott street for some good chinese food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
they were such a rip-off ( $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great friendly service , fast seating , fast delivery , excellent sushi .####B-OP B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O

go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O
the food was very good , but not very thai .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
the atmosphere is attractive , but a little uncomfortable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
this is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O

we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant , then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was back-to-back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the selection changes frequently but the basic dishes are always available .####O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
it 's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have eaten at many pizza places around nyc and this is hands down the worst .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

another plus is most of the entrees are approx .####O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O
the bagels always warm , soft on the inside , crispy on the outside and enormous in size .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
we were less than impressed .####O O O O B-OP O
i generally like this place .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the space is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
as a fan of thai , i have tried quite a few different restaurants in nyc and this one was definitely the worst .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
an unpretentious spot in park slope , the sushi is consistently good , the service is pleasant , effective and unassuming .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O
the food is good , i ca n't lie .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
while the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made tiffin so attractive , the menu has been overhauled .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i do n't think i would go again .####O O O O O O O O O
excellent dumplings served amid clean , chic decor .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
the pizza was pretty good and huge .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
the only thing i could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this restaurant used to be pretty decent .####O O O O O O B-OP O
the neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
ca n't wait to go back .####O O O O O O O
try the homemade breads .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the lox is always fresh too .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
i liked this place the first time but doubt i will ever return .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was very disappointed with this restaurant .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
all the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that i have had in the city .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
they forgot a sandwich , did n't include plastic forks , and did n't include pita with the hummus platter .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
sapphire is the only indian restaurant i go to when i 'm in nyc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would not have been so disappointed with the portions if the qualities were good enough to make up for it , but they were not !####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
went to ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as i love la pizza fresca ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and there 's no way out .####O O O O O O O
if only they delivered , they 'd make a mint !####O O O O O O O O O O O
my boyfriend had the new england chowder it was good but i think the award should go to the lobster bisque .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
all in all we 're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks !!!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's really a takeaway place , i would n't sit if i could take it home .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the place is popular with families , so if you 're bothered by children running loose like wild animals , come later at night to avoid them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the music was fascinating , but left room for conversation , and the bartender made superb drinks .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
do n't judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the homemade guacamole , the unbelievable entree , and thee most amazing deserts .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
ive passed by the spot tons of times always wanting to go in .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
perhaps it was an off night , but it was suprisingly average for a 9.3 rating .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
my husband and i have been sold on this from the first visit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
best reuben sandwich ever !####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
the crackling calamari salad , which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants , is crispy and lightly dressed .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O
cute place , nice wait staff but would never go there again .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
the sides were ok and incredibly salty .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
dessert : pure disaster .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
i found the food to be outstanding , particulary the salmon dish i had .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
what a great place !####O O B-OP B-ASP O
the worst though was the taste .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
i 've been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when i 'm craving for pho , lemon grass chicken or beef cube on rice , this is the place to go .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
all the staff is absolutely professional !!####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i though it was expensive and i prefer bella via just blocks away by far .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in america ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
too cold to enjoy .####O B-OP O O O
i choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
beef noodle soup is good as well .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
and i could do without the cigar smoke .####O O O O O O O O O
to my right , the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido , rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
i must give it yon out of yon stars !####O O O O O O O O O O
we were seated promptly as we had reservations , however after that the service was slow .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes .####B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
they 're are better taiwanese restaurants and they are located in flushing , queens .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at 5 dumplings for $ 1 , you just can not go wrong .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
limited menu , no-so-fresh ingredients , thinly-sliced fish , fall-apart rice .####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
this place is worth an one-hour drive .####O O O B-OP O O O O
but the pizza is way to expensive .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
a million better places to go in the city .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
to begin , we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave , when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
finally let into the store 5 at a time , to buy expensive slices from a harried staff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
we left , never to return .####O O O O O O O
i have n't been to the other locations .####O O O O O O O O O
i ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O
my husband and i have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar ( chef yoshi ) and ordered everything ala carte .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
montparnasse 's desserts -- especially the silken creme brulee and paper-thin apple tart -- are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
incredible food at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic thai restaurant .####B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
nevertheless , i finished my plate , and that 's when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
i highly recommend this beautiful place .####O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
i love this place more and more everytime i go .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O

by the time we were done , it was past 1:00 am .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wish i could like this place more , and i wish someone would retrain the staff .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
i would n't mind going back some time , but not before trying others nearby .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
too bad latin quarters closed .####O B-OP O O O O
the combination of fresh tomato sauce , fresh mozz cheese , basil and the dough they make with imported flour , makes this is one of the better pizza 's in ny .####O O O B-OP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
go there once and oh yes ... you will go back ... you will ...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
during the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
if you have a dumpling fetish i suggest you try some here !####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O

my daughter and i left feeling satisfied ( not stuffed ) and it felt good to know we had a healthy lunch .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
it took half an hour to get our check , which was perfect since we could sit , have drinks and talk !####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
perhaps this food is considered extreme to an upper east side resident , but for the rest of us who 've actually eaten ethnic food , this is simply dull .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the salads are delicious , both refreshing and very spicy .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O B-OP O
the service was attentive , yet discreet .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
normally that would be improper , however they were all delicious and my host did not complain .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
their whitefish salad is excellent -- all whitefish with a little mayo .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
we walked in on a wednesday night and were seated promptly .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
overall , this is a great new restaurant that has been consistently good every time i have been .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
the service was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush , this is not the place for you .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there is a downside if you 're ordering in -- the delivery guys have major attitude .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
lived in shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship green bo restaurant there .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
skip this restaurant , it 's a big disappointment .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O

the menu is interesting and quite reasonably priced .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O

the servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait ( shortly i might add ) .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we will return many times for this oasis in mid-town .####O O O O O O O O O O O

it 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O
good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off , like in this case .####B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the pizza and wine were excellent - the service too -- but what really made this place was the backyard dining area .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
( 2 ) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of mott street just south of canal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i 've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years : a new jazz bar , the most fantastic dining garden , the best thin crust pizzas , and now a lasagna menu which is to die for ( these are not your average lasagnas ) !####O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O

one of us actually liked the expresso - that 's it .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
what more can you ask for ?####O O O O O O O
either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my wife and i ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
another welcome addition to the neighborhood .####O O O O O O O

the seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
the service is always bad though , do n't expect much of anything from your server , and i would not recommend bringing a date here either .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O

the food is great and reasonably priced .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O

although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and service overcompensate .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O
i have been in nyc for over 10 years and could not find this delicacy east of the hudson .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

do not try unless you 're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
even the pasta is delicious here ( a rarity in new york pizza restaurants ) .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O

the hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i asked repeatedly what the status of the meal was and was pretty much grunted at by the unbelievably rude waiter .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O

a con was the slow bar service .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
way too much money for such a terrible meal .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O

my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

most importantly , food is excellent .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O

the atmosphere is n't the greatest , but i suppose that 's how they keep the prices down .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

tell them herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

when my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

another review here claimed the pre-fix was $ 29/per person including sake but it is $ 55 per person not including sake .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say " i 've been to the four seasons restaurant " .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O

the spicy mussels are a highlight .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
but who says murray 's is anything about service .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
try the spicy shrimp appetizer ( again , not the greatest value in the world but worth the price ) and the lamb vindaloo is great .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O

the lava cake dessert was incredible and i recommend it .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O
the food here was mediocre at best .####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O

i really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi on saffron risotto .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
what can you say about a place where the waitress brings out the wrong entree , then verbally assaults your 80 year old grandmother and gives her lip about sending it back ( which she did politely , by the way ) .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
best hot dogs in the tri-state area .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
its a little out of the way if you do n't live in the neighborhood , but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes ( i have to agree with a previous reviewer ) are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the chilli chicken .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i would definitely come back to this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O
our waitress had apparently never tried any of the food , and there was no one to recommend any wine .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
he was terribly thirsty after the meal too .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O
his food is excellent ( and not expensive by nyc standards - no entrees over $ 30 , most appetizers $ 12 to 14 ) .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i had the salmon dish and while it was fine , for the price paid , i expected it to have some type of flavor .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

i had the lamb special which was perfect .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
meat dishes now adorn the selections , although there 's still a large number of vegetarian-friendly choices .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i felt as though i were eating in paris .####O O O O O O O O O O
the last two times i ordered from here my food was soo spicy that i could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
service was efficient courteous .####B-ASP O B-OP B-OP O

what came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
this place is amazingly bad .####O O O O B-OP O
however , for what we spent , overall , it just was not up to par .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
how do you rate home ?####O O O O O O
try the tandoori salmon !####O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the price is reasonable although the service is poor .####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
oh yes , and if you are a fan of indian oldies film stars , there are plenty of portraits of indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls , some of which , i would love to know where they obtained .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

service was very prompt but slightly rushed .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O
and i have been around the block , to say the very least .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am not sure if i would call the food here indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be french with an indian or exotic touch .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant , and passing by it on a daily basis , we decided to try .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we 've found it to be better and fresher than kiku which is comparable in price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
chinese desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
it can not be the ambience , because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the bread is the soft paratha bread ( unlike the plain bread they use in calcutta ) , and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful .####O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O B-OP O
the service is spotty , sometimes really friendly and sometimes barely there .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O
then they somehow made a dry and burnt crust , around a raw and cold inside .####O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
for the price , you can not eat this well in manhattan .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not think dinner in manhattan should cost $ 400.00 where i am not swept off my feet .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love to visit murrays for my bagel fix .####O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O

it has been my first choice ever since i discovered it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
but they 've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the godmother pizza ( a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual ) .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

the service was dreadfully slow ( the place was only half full ) and a smile would have been nice ...####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for chinatown ) alternative .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O

the food was bland oily .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the food was average to above-average ; the french onion soup filling yet not overly impressive , and the desserts not brilliant in any way .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O

it is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O

even though the restaurant was packed , we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems .####O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
we got a little tipsy from the sake but is n't that what saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about ?####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O

the italian food has flavor ( that can be sort of surprising on the ues ) , and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive , they sort of remind me of the ny yankees of the late 90 's , no matter how bad it look , you knew that there was a rally just around the corner ...####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

what really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices , and all made in-house ( even the gyro meat and sausages ) , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O O

the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is definitely good , but i left a bit disappointed .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
expectations were real hi reading the ' 10 's ' .####O O O O O O O O O O O

though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room ( no matter what the size of your party ) , the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters - you 'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you 're in .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O

i recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys fine cuisine at reasonable prices .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
the outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O

stick with the chicken , beef , and lamb dishes .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O

the waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
it 's super-trendy and there 's always someone to take that empty seat , so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
this place is to be avoided .####O O O O O B-OP O
the food is so cheap and the waiters are nice .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O

we were seated at the sushi bar in front of yasuda .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
when the main course finally arrived ( another 45 mins ) half of our order was missing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and we were thouroughly disapointed .####O O O O B-OP O
the food is prepared quickly and efficiently .####O O O O O O O O
obviously run by folks who know a pie .####O O O O O O O O O
the large selection of bruschettas , paninis , tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating .####O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O
these are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner :####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place has ruined me for neighborhood sushi .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
if this happens , just ask for real naan .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
also , specify if you like your food spicy - its rather bland if you do n't .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
sometimes you pay a lot and do n't get much in return - it 's manhattan , things are expensive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the one positive thing i can say is that the service was prompt , we got seated right away and the server was very friendly .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
also , top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O

the menu has lots of options : i hope to go back to try those potato pancakes .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this place is incredibly tiny .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
pizzas were excellent in addition to appetizers and main courses .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
next time , we would n't dare ordering anything else other than some simple asian appetizers and drinks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
the food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
its not the same if you have to sit inside .####O O O O O O O O O O O
my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i came to fresh expecting a great meal , and all i got was marginally so-so food served in a restaurant that was just so freezing we could n't enjoy eating .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
the pizza 's are made fresh , crispy , and ready to serve .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O

service was also very good .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O

bad staff####B-OP B-ASP
the staff is n't the friendliest or most competent , and i am stickler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
please be aware that it 's cash or amex only !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the dessert ( we had a pear torte ) was good - but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
not only would i not recommend jimmy 's restaurants to friends , i would strongly suggest they go anywhere but .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the other times i 've gone it 's romantic date heaven , you can walk in get a booth by the windows , be treated like a vip in a not-crowded place , with great food and service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O

one caveat : some of the curried casseroles can be a trifle harsh .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
all we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
to be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

drawbacks : service is slow and they do n't toast !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
to dine at thalia can be slightly deceiving because while its beautiful on the outside , its so bland on the inside .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O

as many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the appetizers are also delicious !####O B-ASP O O B-OP O

the food was very well prepared .####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O

this tiny williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently while it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O

the service is a bit slow , but harkens back to my years growing up in napoli , italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
they brought glasses and the bottle , and just left the bottle at our table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i 've lived in ny for 5 years and this place has it all .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
the bread was stale , the salad was overpriced and empty .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine , so if you want to make a reservation you are limited .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
if we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
menu - uneventful , small .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
all in all the food was above average and i would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
if you are someone who appreciates simplicity , elegance , and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size , kai is your place .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
it 's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic , even .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O
while i quite liked the food and the ambience , i 'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
they were dry , stale and pretty flavorless .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-OP O
it was horrible .####O O B-OP O
i would go back .####O O O O O
yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously , but it should n't .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
word of advice , save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you 've had the tiramisu .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
however it is the only taiwanese restaurant in town .####O O O O O O O O O O

gigino 's in wagner park is so enjoyable .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
however , there is just something so great about being outdoors , in great landscaping , enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down .####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O

the food is good , i ca n't lie .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
also , the sandwiches ( nearing $ 7 ) did n't come with anything like chips or a side .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service was attentive , yet unimposing , the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O

i think the restaurant was too loud ( when full ) to be romantic .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
i stumbled upon this great pizzeria as i explored my new neighborhood .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
the sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O
a great place to meet up for some food and drinks ...####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i highly recommend it .####O O O O O

it 's not mind-blowing , but to me , thai food never is and never will be .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
have been several times and it never dissapoints .####O O O O O O O O O
there was only one waiter for the whole restaurant upstairs .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
based on the reviews on here , it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 pm .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
went there for a special celebration .####O O O O O O O

im not necessarily fanatical about this place , but it was a fun time for low pirces .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
the pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when he 's not making authentic neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms , he 's visiting the regulars ( a growing legion ) and checking on newcomers .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it is very overpriced and not very tasty .####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
the place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O

i recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O

maybe it 's that most of dumont 's patrons are younger and have lower expectations , but i can not recommend dumont .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in hoboken .####O O O O O O O O O O O
our first course was tuna sashimi with green yuzu sauce .####O O O O O O O O O O O

this place does n't get the publicity that sylvias soul food restaurant does , but it should .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you should travel from the bronx to try it ...####O O O O O O O O O O
the pizza and wine were excellent - the service too -- but what really made this place was the backyard dining area .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
we were very impressed with the food and value .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
even better , they know how to cook french classics like steak au poivre and onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
secondly , on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the best pork souvlaki i ever had is the main thing .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O

food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience ) .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
place should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic ...####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the east village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
this is can became on e of the ny italian food fare institutions .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n’t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but i ’ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O
definitely not a restaurant to skip !####O O O O O O O
i really recommend the very simple unda egg rolls .####O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
at the end you 're left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
enjoy !####B-OP O
great romantic place for a date ( try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close ! ) .####B-OP B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
my personal favorite is nick and joe 's .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
i was in love with pongsri on 48th , but compared to suan it is slow in service and overpriced .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
be careful , when they say spicy , they mean it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , i think this place is a good hang out spot .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the pasta was well cooked , did n't have enough sauce though or flavor .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the service is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the overall price tag was very very expensive , something i did expect .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i have eaten there 3-4 times and the food was always good .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
service is fast and friendly .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
the place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what i could tell , a reasonable wine list ( i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins )####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
looking around , i saw a room full of new yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
truly the mark of an attentive waiter .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
however , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
as always we had a great glass of wine while we waited .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n't even close to sizzling .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
there was a great deal for 6 blue point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $ 8 !####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
if you go for the pre-theatre menu , it 's an even greater deal .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
this place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls - i am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional ...####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O
one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
once they ran out of gnochi and made it for me from scratch !####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they sell special sushi , everything have a topping , sauce and etc .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
it ’s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘ excuse me ’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i live on the street this place is on .####O O O O O O O O O O
i am happy i did the food was awsome .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine !!!####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O
our first time in new york and we had to try a new york bagel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
we are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included : ceviche mix ( special ) , crab dumplings , assorted sashimi , sushi and rolls , two types of sake , and the banana tempura .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
sit back in one of those comfortable chairs .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i was wrong .####O O O O
of course the reason its so packed is because the food is so delicious !####O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
they are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey .####B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
some pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing not impressive at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i dont how this place is still running .####O O O O O O O O O
the only fallback on this restaurant is the prices .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
my friend told me about this restaurant for a year before he finally took me this weekend .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm not sure why these other reviewers are whining so much .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hip boutiques and bars on ludlow add to the artsy , laid-back atmosphere at this israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
if your favorite chinese food is general tao chicken , then this is not your place .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
great selection of wine , and seafood .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O
i have never had cheescake like this .####O O O O B-ASP O O O
if you 've ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
go only if you are already in the neighborhood and do n't want to bother going farther for a better place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the service is horrid !####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
nicky the nose at the bar is a treat .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
we were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
don pedro 's is one of my favorite restaurants .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O

i have been going back again and again .####O O O O O O O O O
the menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP O O O O

by dinner time , they turn it around and mount a huge comeback !!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
did i mention that the coffee is outstanding ?####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
this place is pricey , and yes , the food is worth it ; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
admittedly , this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate ( and thank goodness , in my opinion ) but for simple , elegant sushi there is no better place in new york or anywhere in the us .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the makhani was ok -- the korma was bland .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i ca n't believe people complain about no cheese sticks ?####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
because of the delicate thin crust , take-out pies get soggy in their boxes .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
cornelia street looks like a broadway set for west side story and the inside of po is so cool quaint you really ca n't top the setting for a romantic dinner in nyc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
read all the other review , they 'll confirm it .####O O O O O O O O O O O
when you 're sitting in their main dining room ( which has a spectacular , hand-painted high ceiling ) you 'd never know there was a world outside .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O

after reading the good reviews of this restaurant , i decided to give it a try with two friends .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

everyone who works there ( the host , the bartender , the servers ) is so helpful .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O

please try the filet mignon , its just the most tender piece ever .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
you must try the garlic soup !####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
you can not go wrong at the red eye grill .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
not because you are " the four seasons " ... – you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
order the panang duck , it 's fantastic .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
the place 's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O
the bruscetta is a bit soggy , but the salads were fresh , included a nice mix of greens ( not iceberg ) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O

worth visiting the 1st ave spot because it is the original store .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
a beef consomme .####O O O O
i 'm surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here - i 've been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
when my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
