as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box , i questioned my judgement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never use all the " whistles and bells " this machine is capable of .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i love this camera .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am returning the broken one today .####O O O O O O O O
after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't think i was asking too much .####O O O O O O O O O O
and then it breaks .####O O O O O
worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
sound : exceptional , though i can ' t really compare it to the ipod .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
do not buy this product --####O O O O B-ASP O
the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O
i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8-1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;####O O O O O O O O O O
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
good thing i got a replacement plan .####O O O O O O O O
once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .####B-ASP O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .####O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
we tried the " finding nemo " dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor ; not major ones though ,####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .####O O O O O O O O O O
i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this player .####O B-OP O B-ASP O
typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps .####O O O O O O O O
my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if it had the same number of " ? " s then it would ask if you want to overwrite another song that just had the same number of " ? " s. . .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the phone is small , light , and very attractive .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O
this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he 'd answered all my questions ( same interaction as i just described ) , and well . . .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
all i am looking for is a rebate form !####O O O O O O O O O O
different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds . even though they were not damaged in any way .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
color screen is good .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
silverish color really adds a special touch .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well that is not true .####O O O O O O
i feel that once i contact amazon that they will get to the bottom of this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that is where my satisfaction ends .####O O O O O O O
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
second , the " automatic " sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute ... mostly because of the whole battery issue , i do n't have the patience for those sorta things .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
i agree with the positive reviews .####O O O O O O O
the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O
you can get a pretty good progressive scan sony or toshiba now for 68 bucks just about anywhere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i figured with a great first product and with this one having more features than the 600 i would buy one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
scroll bar :####O O O
it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby .####O O O O O O O O O O
there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am quite happy with the camera .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
my " fast forward " button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O
it really does n't make any cents $ $ to build a great reputation then destroy it from lack a research and testing in one season .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and also , it 's priced very affordably .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O
it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if i could give this a negative rating , i would .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the plus points are -####O O O O O
a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one horrible flaw , or mayybe more than one .####O O O O O O O O O O
after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when talking the voice is not very clear .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
compusa , memorex , fuji .####O O O O O O
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so now it still plays everything , you just can ' t see it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .####O O O O O O O O
i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .####O O O O O O O O O O O
- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the distortion is not a flaw .####O O O O O O O
it is easy to " focus " in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
80 % of the features on here you will not get by spending $ 100 on a sony or panasonic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only significant complaint is sound quality .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
those used to 35 mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
perhaps there is a way around this delay .####O O O O O O O O O
11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
but for now this will do .####O O O O O O O
choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx 's rechargeable battery .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
personally , i do n't understand all the complaints about the interface . . .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?####O O O O O O O O O O
after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the vibration is not top .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get " stuck " rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP
i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
buttons do seem a little sticky tho . . and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem . .####B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i applied a $ 25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying $ 29 for this machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do not underestimate this in your purchase decision .####O O O O O O O O O
for the price and size and features , you can ' t beat the price .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .####O O O O O O O O
( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player . for the first three hours , and then it died .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
want the laundry list of reasons why ?####O O O O O O O O
great quality picture and features .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a winner .####O O O O O
amazon has been working with me to refund my money , but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after " loading " for what seemed like a very long time , the display indicated " no disk " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1 . for some sizing information ) .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can ' t connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately it turns out to be the " disposable " type .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
it 's horrible .####O O O O
1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* price and capacity####O B-ASP O B-ASP
you can also set a background wallpaper .####O O O O O O O O
battery life is good for a phone of this size .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .####O O O O O O O O O O O
in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's money down the drain .####O O O O O O O
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high speed internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall i like it .####O O O O O
i 've registered this unit at www.apexdigialinc.com and listed the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it !####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i also registered the unit online and posted two messages to the apex support person ( there can ' t possibly be more than one !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
like other reviewers , installation was hell .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this phone is a winner ...####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , i can ' t understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
carry your entire collection !####O O O O O
it 's easy .####O O O O
i 'll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
for the most part this is a good dvd player .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
updating the unit 's firmware :####O O O O O O
basic shipping was a bit slow , but that 's okay .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 " tv ) .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title . .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and " explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player " to replace the mediasource .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
you need the software to actually transfer files####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP
still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
that player is a complete piece of sh *** .####O O O O O O O O O O
i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
after having bought and been disappointed in another brand of dvd player , i purchased the apex ad2600 from amazon and first of all i should say it was delivered much more quickly than i had expected .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it says i have a harddisk problem .####O O O O O O O O
reading the reviews , it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i just put it on " shuffle " , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can ' t access them quickly when you need them !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this did not give me enough control .####O O O O O O O O
do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if it can fit in the drive bay , this dvd player will play it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think a $ 39 dissapointment is better then a $ 125 dissapointment !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the " rigor " of a business traveler .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
can ' t say whether i rec 'd an " updated " model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O
the battery is nice .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
amazon is awaesome !####B-ASP O B-OP O
also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't waste your money .####O O O O O O
the zen has no stop button .####O O O O O O O
the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O
is my unit defective ?####O O O O O
the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now .####O O O O O O O O O O
in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
i will never buy another apex digital product !####O O O O O O O O O
when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall an excellent phone .####O O B-OP B-ASP O
in manual , you can set it to " single af " where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
they authorized my late return , and hopefully they are giving apex heck .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i just got it today and have tried to verify the claims of other reviewers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bait and switch .####O O O O
the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O

the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can ' t do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased this player last week .####O O O O O O O
i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
audio on video also lacking .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
and those songs mostly are 320 kbps .####O O O O O O O O
no difference .####O O O
as it is , i 'm keeping the machine .####O O O O O O O O O O
for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O

umm , well , thanks for nothing .####O O O O O O O O
ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so why lie about it ?####O O O O O O
i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .####O O O O O O O O O O
well to say , i had a very bad history with players .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this almost made it worth the price alone .####O O O O O O O O O

by what time standards -- martian ?####O O O O O O O
however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is " sold out " or more likely " discontinued " at the almighty amazon.com ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
great feature list , poor reliability .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .####O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the powershot g3 is a great camera .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this thing kicks mighty apple butt !####O O O O O O O
disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O

i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
take my words and give it a try .####O O O O O O O O O
it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't have a dvd + r to try####O O O O O O O O O O
my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
cleaned the dvd , tried again , no luck .####O O O O O O O O O O
drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i listened to it for several days before needing to recharge them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of " now playing " interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
this thing plays everything i feed it .####O O B-ASP O O O O O
honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'll just say this . . .####O O O O O O O O
it 's a very intuitive program .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
that was annoying .####O O O O
i ordered this player for christmas , and so far i have it for only 2 weeks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and how can i do that ... .####O O O O O O O O
i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .####O O O O O O O O O O O
yup , right back for a refund !####O O O O O O O O
the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O

now my dissapointments .####O O O O
i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
third party software to the rescue####O O O O O O
and go from there ... if you chose one of the " all " options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
amazon.com promptly refunded my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazon.com !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me :####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i followed their advice but that failed , too .####O O O O O O O O O O
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
creative provided e-mail support ;####O O O O O
it 's almost like having a media player / file manager built into the dvd player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i should n't have been cheap , should have bought a toshiba .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
yes , i recommend it over the competition .####O O O O O O O O O
the batteries would not charge .####O O O O O O
excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
oh ... one more thing .####O O O O O O
bought one for $ 49.99 .####O O O O O O
after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i simply watched the extra features on another player .####O O O O O O O O O O
i treat the battery well and it has lasted .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
no line out jack - as i said , there is none .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 . it 's a hazard in the car .####O O O O O O O O O O
the player itself has all sorts of problems .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O
it is not perfect though .####O O O O O O
i checked with nokia .####O O O O O
3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
my favorite is to play " any track " - am rediscovering my music !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just make sure the keys are locked .####O O O O O O O O
it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has a hold button to deactivate the buttons to avoid accidents ; however , enough reviewers have complained that the hold button is easily broken and then the device can ' t be used .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O

the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hopefully the replacement from amazon will work just fine .####O O O O O O O O O O

it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not an urgent issue , as it still works . . .####O O O O O O O O O O O O

extremely convenient .####O O O
both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
the second one is up and running .####O O O O O O O O

3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ordered two of these puppies for christmas gifts .####O O O O O O O O O O
what the heck is up with the 2600 .####O O O O O O O O O
bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were " ? " s and even though the songs had different names in chinese . .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
7 picture quality is excellent .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
one minor complaint :####O O O O
i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
i got an rma from creative , sent my player in to them for repairs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile " hot-spots " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .####O O O O O O O O O O O
scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are not a lot of good options out there .####O O O O O O O O O O O
battery life is ok .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
no way , now i have an ipod and i 'm a very happy man .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
repost from january 13 , 2004 with a better fit title .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is extemely lame .####O O O O O
they sent me a new ad2600 with the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i can do that myself .####O O O O O O
the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )####O O O O O O O
hopefully you wo n't regret .####O O O O O O
because , you will be dissapointed .####O O O O O O O
i find this to be a great feature .####O O O O O O O O O
100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
took hundreds of pictures and they were great .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it did lock up on me a couple of times .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat . clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got every song i had downloaded to the player within a day or so .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this player is an ideal purchase .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you need the remote control for this so you better get it from your dog before he burries it in the backyard .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review , similar to when i look in the mirror .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
get one now !####O O O O
this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
mediasource did not recognize my tags !####B-ASP O O O O O O
i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now , for the t-mobile service :####O O O O O O O
it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go :####O O O O O O O O O O O O
now i know why - they are pieces of junk .####O O O O O O O O O O O
now i need to buy myself another one !####O O O O O O O O O
unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
cheaper in every way .####O O O O O
the battery life on this phone is surreal .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
i 've had the player for about a month now .####O O O O O O O O O O O
back to the 2600 :####O O O O O
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 " or 5x7 " prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 " photos once in a while .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
6 . the g2 's " color effect " exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable " effect func " menu option available in all exposure modes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( i guess only time will tell ? )####O O O O O O O O O
the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
+ screen was good , easy to read####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP
excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
now i have to return it and rip all my music again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i 'm not looking forward to ripping my entire collection every month or two .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software sucks .####O B-ASP B-OP O
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what a junk .####O O O O
i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of " juice " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but they offer only a 3-month warranty ( on all of their players , including the zen xtra ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O O O
it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O
hi , many people are saying , " you get what you pay for , i guess . "####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
( my orignal review is below : )####O O O O O O O O
i own a 35 mm slr camera and this is my second digital .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit , he said , " actually we do n't ship on saturdays " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i enthusiastically recommend this camera .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i got one of these to serve as a second dvd player in my house .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i 've yet to be dissappointed .####O O O O O O O
battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i guess you get what you pay for .####O O O O O O O O O
so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what a disappointment !####O O O O
the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the button on the remote to switch from pal to ntsc was undoubtedly my problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory .####O O O O O O O O O O O
also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no-one mentions whether there is a stop button , but the photos do n't show one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am still trying to resolve it four months later .####O O O O O O O O O O O
also , they 'd forgotten to add " wap " capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 . the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the canon g3 .####O O O O
excellent range of metering options as well .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
i purchased one of these to replace an ailing dvd player that 's a few years old .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great phone . . .####B-OP B-ASP O O O
after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ok , that happens , so i try to skip the chapter .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend buying one .####O O O O O O
after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one still works fine , the other quit after one day .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary . . .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just be aware of it .####O O O O O O
for ipod you have to buy a cable and it is n't compatible with all windows pcs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sound quality :####O O O
moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
buy new ones asap . every time you move your face or something they pop out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm compatible phone .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i even went as far as calling the technical support number on the disc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the " year " field .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
now , i suddenly have no picture .####O O O O O O O O
size and weight :####O O O O
the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am very pleased so far .####O O O O O O O
it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O
they stop time .####O O O O
radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpiece in .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
that beside you are prob . very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not many .####O O O
if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search function is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .####B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software , mediasource , can not work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great design and looks cool .####O O O O O O
one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35 mm .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program .####O O O O O O O O O
it 's probably good for the health of your ears , however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range ( and my hearing is fine ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it ! !####O O O O O
that 's probably a bad thing .####O O O O O O O
messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the phone has several color schemes you can choose from .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera . .####O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O
ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) .####B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O

12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the reception and sound quality are top-notch .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O
it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
proven canon built quality and lens .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
the light goes from red to green but no display or any operation whatsoever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a great buy .####O O O O
now where did i put that manual ?####O O O O O O O O
6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i guess you get what you pay for .####O O O O O O O O O
no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that meant even less light and just as much action .####O O O O O O O O O O O
be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great features . .####O O O O
i have had this phone for about 5 months .####O O O O O O O O O O
i 'd recommend against this unit .####O O O O O O O
the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , a good buy for the price .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
gee ... thanks a lot creative .####O O O O O O O
the ipod 's white plastic look / surface does n't suit me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00 . but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need :####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a great deal in general !####O O O O O O
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my opinions :####O O O
but if you 've used a slr 35 mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apex sucks !####B-ASP B-OP O
i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can ' t , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall i like the unit .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .####O O O O O O O O O O
output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer , using my work computer instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
signal strength will affect the battery life .####O O O O O O O O
software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player . . .####B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now , i thought it 's time to upgrade .####O O O O O O O O O O
software - the software is crap .####B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
those that have it like it .####O O O O O O O
forget about it .####O O O O
i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband .####O O O O O O O O O O O
if you want to be a poser and follow the herd , mooooooh , then buy the i-pod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display " lens " when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased this as a christmas gift on 12-4 - 03 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , not with this one .####O O O O O O O
yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the cd just has too many problems with win xp .####O O O O O O O O O O O
now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable , as i already had a coax cable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
for the price it is a well spent investment !####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i expect the g3 will please me for years to come .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
apex is made in usa and is one of the underrated brands out there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend this product to anyone .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O
also , the lens cap design is flawed .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
- solid , high-quality construction####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP
however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is all i have to say .####O O O O O O O O
navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
the g2 was better in this respect .####O O O O O O O O
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
interface - practically seamless .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
big mistake .####O O O
the downside though , may be a big one for you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can ' t comment on any problems there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the pros :####O O O
the movie mode is also working great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
forget about the sleek looks if it can ' t play some of your real dvds .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP
for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
you have to ask yourself , " how much money is dissapointment worth ? "####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also has unproven battery life .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the " scene " mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a " regular " setting .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
i purchased the nikon 4300 after several weeks of searching .####O O O O O O O O O O O

the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .####O O O O O O O O O O O
without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O

tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service from the supplier was exceptional .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the player kept displaying " no disc " , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * !####O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
no more annoying series of beeps .####O O O O O O O

if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i was told that it is no longer available , so there must be something really wrong with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
bought the apex ad-2600 from amazon in 12/03 mainly on price , $ 49.99 - $ 10 rebate = $ 39.99 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that takes up half the space of mp3 's .####O O O O O O O O O O
it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .####O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O
for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the prior one looked and felt lightweight , cheesy , and assembled by the oppressed :####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was just a problem with the player .####O O O O O O O O O
the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28 mm filters are expensive and hard to find .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this camera has a major design flaw .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
the pro ...####O O O
based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards . . . they were ) . . .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the " # " key instead .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
