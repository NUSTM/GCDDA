i am stuck with a laptop that i can not do very much with .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has been plagued with problems since the day i turned it on .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
then , one month after the warranty expired , the replacement charger went .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
the reaction of toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention pc 's require .####O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this laptop leaves alot to be desired , i have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice ...####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , there are major issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O

the superdrive is quiet .####O B-ASP O B-OP O

it 's so nice that the battery last so long and that this machine has the snow lion !####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i went with him and we picked this one .####O O O O O O O O O O

i just ca n't fathom that the celebrated dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products - it only survives b/c its substandard laptops are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising programs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i honestly love my mac , thats why i am a self proclaimed mac addict .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seems like maybe a bad shipment from toshiba .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
this is my second laptop , and it is head and shoulders above my first .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the first time i used the card reader it took half an hour and a pair of tweezers to remove the card .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the little battery that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's wonderful for computer gaming .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
i have had it for almost four years now and i have only had a few problems with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

if you faintly come close to touching this thing while typing , all craziness may break loose .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am replacing the hd with a micron ssd soon .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
the materials that came with the computer did not include the right # anywhere .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the computer did what it was not supposed to do , and i did n't know what to do ....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am not happy with my purchase####O O O O O O O
10 hours of battery life is really something else ....####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
this was an update from an early macbook pro .####O O O O O O O O O O
however , this laptop has a fatal flaw that i discovered merely a week after buying it .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O
we were occasional mac users before , but most recently owned a budget pc since it is what we could afford .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the track pad to me is what really stands out though , you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad , awesome thinking apple !####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
good laptop for the money .####B-OP O O O O O

i eventually did the migration from my imac backup disc which uses usb .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O
so needless to day , i 'm not happy .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i bought this last week , and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch mouse stopped responding .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O
it has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp .####O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
all the ports are much needed since this is my main computer .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the graphics and screen are stunning and although i was a pc person , i was able to understand how to use a mac fairly quickly .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
completely worth every single penny dime and nickel .####O B-OP O O O O O O O
i went to toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
i have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free , even without the warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O
my only complaint is the total lack of instructions that come with the mac mini .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i guess he was the technical person .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my pc did , and i have all of the programs that were on my pc .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
looks nice , but has a horribly cheap feel .####B-ASP B-OP O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O
i use my friends and family 's $ 2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and hp , well , i 'll never buy or recommend an hp to anyone !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were sol there to , so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O
only thing i would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
finally decided to try a mac because there were too many choices of which pc 's to buy and everyone who had a mac said " buy a mac " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not enough time for me to give it 5 stars !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen is n't huge , but that does n't matter when i output media to the 50 inch lcd tv .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would say that 85 % of the design industry is mac for good reason .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also does not have bluetooth .####O O O O O B-ASP O
it is extremely portable and easily connects to wifi at the library and elsewhere .####O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
lightweight , long battery life , excellent transition from pc ;####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O

i 've always used pc 's for work home and this is my first experience with a mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe the mac os improvement were not the product they want to offer .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
my only gripe would be the need to add more ram .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this laptop is a great price and has a sleek look .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
avoid this model .####O O O O

i do n't have that additional money right now , and therefore would n't have purchased it at this time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i got the first " blue screen of death " in the early part of july .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my laptop is almost 2 yrs old and i have never had any problems with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

bottom line , if you can afford it , get a mac !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate to say this , but if i could take this back to the shop and get my money back , then i would .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
either way , the keyboard is unsatisfactory .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O

overall , i experienced a huge change in that my mac runs pretty fast compared to my old pc .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
i purchased my first mac and am glad i did .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
whenever tried to turn it on , it would restart as soon as the bios launched windows ( or winblows , as i like to call it ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it may take a little getting used to but you do n't have to worry about viruses or other headaches .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought it during the recent comex it show .####O O O O O O O O O O

with windows laptops a wireless mouse is an absolute must .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O
even though it is running snow leopard , 2.4 ghz c2d is a bit of an antiquated cpu and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running office mac applications such as word or excel .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i had my iworks , itunes , email , ms office , network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
one bad thing is it gets hot .####O O O O O O B-OP O
the software is amazing .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
good in every aspect .####B-OP O O O O
the screen is nice and the images comes very clear , the keyboard and the fit just feels right .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O

the battery was completely dead , in fact it had grown about a quarter inch thick lump on the underside .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other thoughts : received replacement 16 days later .####O O O O O O O O O
no installation disk ( dvd ) is included .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O
the difference in the apple keyboard from a pc 's keyboard took a bit of time to get used to , but overall it 's worth it !####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i am paying apple to kill my self and my wallet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are so realistic i am just speechless .####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
searched it on amazon and on bestbuy .####O O O O O O O O
i think that was a great decision to buy####O O O O O B-OP O O O
it has a overheating issue - nearly to the point of being dangerous .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
i went right out and purchased another laptop .####O O O O O O O O O
i was very worried about making the two compatible - but literally , it was so simple i was almost worried that i was doing something wrong .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the toshiba laptop i am using is easier to use than most i have tried .####O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
apple " help " is a mixed bag .####B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i found the mini to be : exceptionally easy to set up####O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP
i 'm new - just switched from years of pc frustration .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought them for my college age grandchildren and these macs are totally reliable and support their class work 100 % of the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
that is how it is able to function better than any other pc .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
yes , i have it on the highest available setting .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i was given a mac as a birthday present and could n't be happier with it 3 years later .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
that 's a huge difference .####O O O O O O
i have now had it for 1.5 months and love it .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
apple did a great job .####O O O B-OP O O
easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i love the form factor .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook , it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
its not just slow on the internet , its slow in general .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O
i 'm going back to pc .####O O O O O O O
i my wife is also now the proud owner of a macbook as well !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this newer netbook has no hard drive or network lights .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to !####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
its everything mac offers .####O O O O O
a second problem involves the battery which is advertised as having a storage life of 11 hours but when fully charged shows only 7 hours of service .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the lesson learned here is : it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand , since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible , as fast as they can , and in this day and age , the customer no longer is right all the times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since the machine 's slim profile is critical to me , that was a problem .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
was n't sure if i was going to like it much less love it so i went to a local best buy and played around with the ios system on a mac pro and it was totally unique and different .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i loved it .####O B-OP O O
the graphics on this computer are also stellar - very clear and vivid .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-OP O
runs like a champ .....####B-ASP O O O O
i love to use it it is easy and light .####O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
the thunderbolt port is awesome !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
but sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i had finally reached my limit and broke down .####O O O O O O O O O O
we figure that after everything his pc actually ended up costing $ 350 more than my original mac .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
this computer is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O
would pay more for it if i had too !####O O O O O O O O O O
not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
the macbook pro is very sturdy and versatile .####O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use .####O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
i would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
its also fun to use !####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i love the glass touchpad .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
the right speaker did not work .####O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O
apple no longer includes idvd with the computer and furthermore , apple does n't even offer it anymore !####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
such as pages , numbers , and so on .####O O O O O O O O O O
great deal on an amazing lap top !####B-OP O O O B-OP O O O
spent 2 hours on phone with hp technical support .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
it is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
still pretty pricey , but i 've been putting off money for a while as a little macbook fund , and finally got to use it .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in fact , somehow ( and i never opened it up ) some specks of dust or something got inside the screen and are now there permanently , behind the front of the screen , in the way of the display .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O
i have owned at least 4 to 5 laptops and computers - but this is by far the most superior machine i have ever owned .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i have had it 9 months and it is already a $ 250 loss .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with awesome graphics and assuring security , it 's perfect !####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O
cons : price is a bit ridiculous , kinda heavy .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O
logic board utterly fried , cried , and laid down and died .####B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
and i babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it rarely works and when it does it 's incredibly slow .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
would highly recommend this netbook though .####O O B-OP O O O O
if you really want a bang-up system and do n't need to run windows applications , go with an apple ;####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
keyboard is plastic and spongey feeling .####B-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
i get a ton of compliments on its size , and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus , i can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you 're restricted to the width of your body for computing room .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
his language was so bad i swore i was taking the turing test , and it was failing .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i am used to computers with windows so i am having a little difficulty finding my way around .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
though the picture , video , and music software is nowhere close to professional grade software im used to ( cs5 ) but does the job for beginner and even intermediate media designers .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i returned it to best buy on the ninteenth of april .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
dell sucks####O B-OP
the ac power port becomes loose over time####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O
which is what i did , check out my acer 5517 !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
words can not express how much i love my new mac .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
but if you ca n't make your product last more than a year , you will not get my business again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a lifelong windows user , i was extremely pleased to make the change to mac .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i sent it back and found this time that the battery was faulty , so i got a new one and some other fixes they found .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , i had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my pc , but took the apple to the conference .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in fact i still use many legacy programs ( appleworks , filemaker pro , quicken , photoshop etc ) !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
sure hope best buy will replace it asap .####O O O O O O O O O
some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software , but there is no guarantee .####O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
this laptop looks great on the surface : 17 " inch screen , good price-point , nice appearance , boots up quickly , runs fast etc .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O
only good thing is the graphics quality .####O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the new macbook pro 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing .####O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
out of all the laptops i have owned , this is by far the best !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i absolutely love my mac !####O O B-OP O O O
now , the next issue i had freaked me out .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
this laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with .####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O
i told them that i just received my brand new macbook but i was having issues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
my macbook pro is no exception .####O O O O O O O
very powerful especially for the money .####O B-OP O O O O O
i have never really been big on downloading anything so i was n't too worried about getting a virus , plus i thought i was protected by norton .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
since i have always used apple products , the choice of macbook pro was obvious .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've almost have bought every generation of macminis since 2005 , and this one has n't let me down .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is also fast as can be ... you get what you pay for ... well worth the investment####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O
heck , i like all mac computers , but they 're all way too pricey for the kind of economy the u.s. is going through .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i finally pulled the trigger and i am blown away by how much more i enjoy my computer tasks using the mac mini !!!####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it would n't fit in most 17-inch bags .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
the netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
great laptop for school , easy to use for beginners in the household .####B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
then , within 5 months , the charger crapped out on me .####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O
winters is on it 's way and i imagine it will be cozy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
which i still use and have hooked up to my tv .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the port is secured to motherboard so when this happens you ca n't see the plug at all , it 's just gone .####O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
we were pc users .####O O O O O
what a waste .####O O B-OP O
for some odd reasons the computer does n't recognize the operation system .####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
in summary , take your money elsewhere .####O O O O O O O O
i am forever changed and will no longer buy a windows based machine for personal use .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
images are crisp and clean .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
the majority of the reviews seem to be for the 13.3 macbook pro model # md101ll/a .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

tech support would not fix the problem unless i bought your plan for $ 150 plus .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i saw walmart had the same computer for about $ 650 but still knowing what i know now , i would not buy it at that price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary product key .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
bottom line , i doubt you 'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i have no idea how to burn cd 's or to use the web cam , just for starters .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
you just lose a customer .####O O O O O O

you know , using the computer should be fun , not aggravation , especially when you are playing games or working with photos .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of laptops .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
most of the large bags are for a 17 inch .####O O O O O O O O O O O
they are closed at 9 pm eastern .####O O O O O O O O
at least those computers did n't just die on me like this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this thing is a lemon .####O O O O O O
they replaced it and so far so good .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
if you get a lemon ( i have two thirds of my macs ) , you have to send it in for repairs several times before they will replace it , even if they have numerous problems with the same version of their computers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the built-in webcam is great for skype and similar video-chat services .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
the battery life was shorter than expected .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O
i can guarantee this will be the last dell i will ever purchase !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard !####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O
the screen is nice , side view angles are pretty good .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O

i do n't have stupid pop up windows ( even when i have pop ups blocked ) , i do n't have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download , and best of all i can run all the web programming software i need to use all at once without slowing me down .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not recommend this company or their products !!!!####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
when the buyer returned it wal mart just boxed it , taped it shut resold it as new .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we carry the netbook around here and there , hence it 's kinda of irritating when the lcd just " slide " downwards .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
this is the first time for me to use a mac and i 'm really happy with the move .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
no , they do n't even support their own bios and it " could be a problem with the bios " how can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity ??!!####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , they do n't care a bunch .####O O O O O O O O O
it 's a decent computer for the price and hopefully it will last a long time .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O

it is in the best condition and has a really high quality .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
games being the main issue .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
a tip for people looking into this computer : do not buy it save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i can throw anything at it ( and i do ) , pictures , video editing , schoolwork .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm honestly afraid that it will burn me , it 's that hot !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and i have never had any issues with it freezing .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if that is the case for you , i would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate it .####O B-OP O O
i got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime i touched the lid , ( mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed ) but i suffered thru it and would constantly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O

it works really well .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
all in all great item highly recommend it .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O
out of the box i noticed how small it was and was exactly what i was looking for .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it has spent more time in repair shops than i can possibly recount here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
theres also idvd , a program dedicated to putting all your favorite media together - photos , recordings , video projects into one program so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents , family , siblings , and any other person important in your life that there may be .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little , while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this can be annoying at first but you just have to train yourself not to to start over so far .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

actually , i had noticed the one on the sales floor also did n't have sound !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

setting would change for some reason , the screen size would change on it 's own , like the pixel sizes and whatnot .####B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
then on top of it all their customer service center is in the middle east .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
but guess what ? ( you have to buy an external dvd drive it does n't have a built in type ) the notebook ca n't be used because it does n't read anything for an external drive .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

also is portable and reliable .####O O B-OP O B-OP O
before i begin , i will say that i am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this computer - i am not an apple fanboy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , i have alot of trouble with it getting very hot , and not even sitting on anything to make it hot .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
only a few days after i received the computer back , the screen froze again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O
and the best part is that it even comes with a free printer ( when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course ) !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
microsoft word was not on it and i had to buy it seperately .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O

my laptop now has no battery .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
is this partially due to the fact that it is running windows vista ?####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
my sister has the same mac as me and she is in a band and uses garageband to record and edit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O

it is small enough to fit in one of my purses !####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O
quality display i love hp , , it 's the only computer/printer we will buy .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it provides much more flexibility for connectivity .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
and not to mention after using it for a few months or so , the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you ca n't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

after talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate , i chose the macbook pro over the white macbook .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
so of course this one came through with the awesomeness !####O O O O O O O O O O O
it really is very light compared to other computers .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
unfortunately , apple 's quality has continued to slide .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i would recommend this acer to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i believe that the quality of a mac is worth the price .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
great product , very easy to use and great graphics .####B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i am sorry that i purchased this laptop .####O O O O O O O O O
reason why ? it 's because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10-20 % , unlike pc laptops which drop more than 80 % .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

they did n't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , hdd secures inside using rails , and there is only one set on the main hard drive .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i would never go back any more , i love this computer so much and i would recommend it to everyone .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i was a little worry at first because i do n't have a lot of experience with os.x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine ;####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O

( beware , their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is by far one of the greatest investments i have ever made .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O
i bought this lap top and the charge time dose n't last as long as they say it will more like 2 hours####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
so , the hard disk capacity really does n't matter to me .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
i bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is easily portable and i take it everywhere i go and might require internet access .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O

i took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
it 's just a great toy to have around .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O
as a computer science student in college , i find that the portability , longevity , and ease of use of this computer make me ( shockingly ) want to do homework more ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased an hp right after my high school graduation .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's even easy to hook up to other wireless networks .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
so this was great for me .####O O O B-OP O O O
love that it does n't take up space like a regular computer .####B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and , if you are going to deal with hp be careful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was really happy because it is a much better price on amazon.com than it was in the mac store .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i am very happy !####O O O B-OP O
do i like the computer ? well , other than not getting viruses , i guess it is ok .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
i bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
while we struggle with all the crashes and viruses , the kids computers stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for business !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
after using it for over a month , an issue started to surface .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm returning mine####O O O O
i love this product because it is toshiba and its 15.6 " .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O

built-in apps are purely amazing .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
the laptop was very easy to set up .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
even though the computer is larger they did not make the keyboard larger .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
2nd best computer in the world only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgrade patches to make less easier for people to hack into####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
this is a great value for the money .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O

it takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site , then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the minute you fire it up it 's all good , very easy user interface .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
i had to return it because it would n't even start .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a cheap throw together .####O O O O O O O
everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure .####O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
but , for the cost this is a winner .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
minis make sense for a lot of people .####O O O O O O O O O
it is robust , with a friendly use as all apple products .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
another two weeks later and it was back in my possession .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
would buy 100 more of these if i could .####O O O O O O O O O O
i love it so much .####O B-OP O O O O

i look forward to years of use , it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
i reinstalled windows through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O
i contacted acer and they are giving me free recovery dvds , so do n't go and pay for them , just ask for them and they should give them to you .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen almost looked like a barcode when it froze .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
the computer could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never go back to a pc again !####O O O O O O O O O O

asked the customer service rep .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i purchased .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i paid about the same for my toshiba as i did for the compaq a few years back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that i have , is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can see why the have soooo much money .####O O O O O O O O O O
seems to me that 's the best way to get apple 's attention .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ca n't imagine my life without it anymore !####O O O O O O O O O O
i do everything on this computer - check email , facebook , shop , check blogs , write papers , listen to music , and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i play a lot of casual games online , and the touchpad is very responsive .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
what a mistake !####O O O O
moving from a pc to mac has never been easier , and i 'm glad that i did it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i saved for this laptop for 3 months and i can tell you personally it was worth the wait .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
never any doubt i would get a macbook , just was n't sure which one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
he ca n't stand it .####O O O O O O
but now i have realized its a problem with this brand .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
1 ) payed $ 2200 for a " premium " laptop####O O O O O O O O O O O
the next time i had an issue my lightscribe would n't work .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about my mac .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O

i loved the netbook ( minus the fact that it was windows os ) until this started happening .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the internet speed is spectacular .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the problems started with just the screen freezing .####O O O O O O O B-OP O
now when i order i did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard i wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when i use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i am a freelance graphic artist .####O O O O O O O
it was getting old and i needed a new school computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
with the upgraded memory , the macbook pro never has an issue running many many applications at once !####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
the only pro to this computer is it was under $ 600 !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
let me tell you , this machine is great .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i opted for the squaretrade 3-year computer accidental protection warranty ( $ 1500-2000 ) which also support " accidents " like drops and spills that are not covered by applecare .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this is what i call a good after sales service .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

this was a significantly more affordable than getting a new macbook pro from apple .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
his was worth $ 36 .####O O O O O O
and toshiba is a quality supplier .####O O O O O O O
it is more than enough computer to keep up with the needs of a high school student .####O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
from the build quality to the performance , everything about it has been sub-par from what i would have expected from apple .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
graphics are much improved .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
i picked it out because it was inexpensive ( $ 400 ) and i thought it would be a good , easy to use first laptop .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
and then , a guy came out to serve me instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
they sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my son and his family have a hard time financially because he is self-employed so the family had no computer of any kind , and kyle the oldest child is 12 and really need something to help him in school .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
still , this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O

i had my pc laptop for 3 years and going to a macbook pro is like i leaped through time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but while this is one big advantage ( as you may know from the company s recent commercials ) there are other things to consider before going with apple .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i had to pay $ 100 for a universal charger for this cheap $ 300 laptop .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O

unfortunately , the laptop i purchased was also a dell and again , i have to say i hated it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O

( you may be reading one now !####O O O O O O O O
finally , the biggest problem has been tech support .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
they went through asking me open up various components , taking battery out , hard disk apart , and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no cd rom in the new version there 's no way i 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O

i will never buy another hp computer .####O O O O O O O O
( i had been a windows / linux user before this ) i love the size because the screen is big enough for what i use it for ( internet , artwork ) , and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O

although i opted for the lowest end macbook pro , this thing holds its own .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook : screen size is not something i 'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O

if you do n't like fingerprints , this might not be the laptop for you .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i will definitely be getting a new laptop if it has any more issues after the warranty expires and researching carefully when i do so i do n't run accross a situation like this again !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i waited and waited and no laptop .####O O O O O O O O
hp pavilion dv9000 notebook pc when i first got this computer , it really rocked .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by week two , my laptop had overheated and was completely dead even though i did not use it too much .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
they have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and i 'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular .####O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i am please with the products ease of use ; out of the box ready ; appearance and functionality .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
it had a seventeen inch screen which i wanted , but i did n't realize at the time it would be such a monster !####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also got the added bonus of a 30 " hd monitor , which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh !####O O O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
but sadly the replacement froze-up while updating the bios again and shut down and would not turn back on .####O B-OP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
purchased as a gift for a friend .####O O O O O O O O

after trying to get some help he disconnected on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in ( mousing over the battery icon would read , for example , " 74 % , plugged in , not charging " ) , requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
a tip for people looking into this computer : do not buy it save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you pay for what you get for .####O O O O O O O O
i like it better than my big dell laptop .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O
my mac is much more efficient than a pc so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was also suffering from hardware ( keyboard ) issues , relatively slow performance and shortening battery lifetime .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
we did n't because it was already over 2,400 dollars !####O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's also very capable of doing moderate video editing ( although you may need the performance boost of the larger macbook pros for heavy duty mobile video editing ) .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O
after fumbling around with the os i started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
have purchased many products over the years from macconnection and this transaction , like all the others , we smoothly with no problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100 % that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also love the small , convenient size of my laptop , making it a perfect tool for my academic studies .####O O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets , and rather quickly too .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O
however , i love this particular mac because its very fast , great size , and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it also comes with 4g of ram but if you 're like me you want to max that out so i immediately put 8g of ram in her and i 've never used a computer that performs better .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
it runs perfectly .####O B-ASP B-OP O
shipped very quickly and safely .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
i bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her , it 's very lightweight , and the response for the computing she 's doing ( internet focused activity : mail , research , etc. ) is excellent ;####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
and at one point , they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when i upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop ( i bought the memory stick they recomended ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
best money i ever spent .####B-OP O O O O O

this is my second macbook .####O O O O O O
i have a lapdesk which i can use , but i can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in my opinion it was not as user friendly as i expected either .####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
i now own another hewlett packard .####O O O O O O O
with what i paid for this computer it should have had everything on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it looks and feels solid , with a flawless finish .####O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i 'll stick to toshiba .####O O O O O O
i can render avchd movies with little effort , which was a problem for most pc 's unless you had a quad core i7 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
he gave me this pc about 3 years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is starting off good .####O O O O B-OP O
from the speed to the multi touch gestures this operating system beats windows easily .####O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP B-ASP O O
it is just slow slow slow .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
one more thing , this mac does not come with restore disks and i am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer pc 's , also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iphone/ipod touch cables .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
this was my first macbook purchase ever .####O O O O O O O O

toshiba is a great brand , even though i have n't had it for a long time , i am very happy with it !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
finally , i purchased a toshiba .####O O O O O O O
awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college .####B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
if you ask me , for this price it should be included .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i ca n't imagine ever buying a pc again !####O O O O O O O O O O
the first time it crashed was maybe going on a year and a half of having it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when you call tech support you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
strengths : well shaped weaknesses : a bad videocard !####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
its perfect , not much heavy .####O B-OP O O O B-OP O
you ca n't even get a satellite card which is why i bought to begin with .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
after doing cad work all day at work , using a higher end pc , i could n't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has good speed and plenty of hard drive space .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i bought it from hsn because it was " bundled " with extra software , but as it turns out , that software just crashes it more often .....####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
has all the other features i wanted including a vga port , hdmi , ethernet and 3 usb ports .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it was loaded with windows vista home premium -- delivered with only 1gb of ram , and it was a * dog * .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O

the unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than apple 's previous laptops .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
they break down just as often as pcs do , and the only reason they do n't get viruses , is because no one makes viruses for them , they 're not better in any way , they are worse , try finding virus protection programs for a mac , they do n't exist .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O

this hardware seems to be better than the imac in that it is n't $ 1400 and smaller .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it doesnt get hot like my pc , with technology always at the tip of our fingertips anytime i forget how to do something i just google it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even with virus protection , it always turned off when updates were needed and installed .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the battery gets so hot it is scary .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O
it lasted for many years of travel , kids and abuse and if i fired it up today , it would work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do not buy it !####O O O O O
the apple applications ( ex . iphoto ) are fun , easy , and really cool to use ( unlike the competition ) !####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
not too expense and has enough storage for most users and many ports .####O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
everything is so easy to use , mac software is just so much simpler than microsoft software .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O

to list a few : they tend to get hot enough to cause 3rd degree burns , as well as ignite any flamable material if near the part that happens to heat up .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
i got this one for thanks giving offer for $ 962 :) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that 's the downside for me .####O O O O O O O
well , i bought this laptop a month or two ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this laptop was bad from the first day of use ---- brought it back to store for return of money .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

with the macbook pro it comes with free security software to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
guess i 'll stay away from hp .####O O O O O O O O

my toshiba did not have sound on everything , just certain things .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
now they are believers in the product .####O O O O O O O O
the ease of set up was terrific .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
this has been nothing but a headache since we purchased it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
yet , hp wo n't do anything about the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O
if it 's not shipped on the next business day , called on a friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

so far , it 's an average laptop - no better , no worse than the hp i replaced .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
the second issue i had with it occured a month later and it kept overheating , even if on for less than an hour !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ultimate graduation gift .####O O O O O
i called back to ensure that received it , they had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O

c'mon , lg .####O O O O
being a tech savvy , apple - product loving person , i 'm glad i finally got the macbook pro !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
you will regret it if you buy any dell .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
if you buy , pray you dont have major problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2.0 hrs when not plugged in .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
that included the extra sony sonic stage software , the speakers and the subwoofer i got ( that was worth the money ) , the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer , the extended life battery and the docking port .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
they really do have the worlds very worst repair service .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it doesnt overheat or make any loud noises .####O O O O O O B-OP O O
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
stay away from hp .####O O O O O
i wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused , because they knew it was trouble .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
after replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working ( 3 months of use ) which was frustrating .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
this computer i used daily nice compact design .####O O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O
i also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
i wish toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the os at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
os x is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook which save heaps of time .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
this netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop ( my wife and i have another laptop ) , or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can call hp and they want you to buy more software to fix it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i finally did it and this machine is the way to go !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , owing to these problems , i went out and got myself an apple macbook pro , which i am using with great satisfaction at this very moment .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
it gives me the power and speed that i need to run all the programs i use to edit .####O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i would highly recommend this macbook .####O O O B-OP O O O
at home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24 " lcd screen , so built in screen size is not terribly important .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
it is loaded with programs that is of no good for the average user , that makes it run way too slow .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
my friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance , picture quality , and ease of use .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
a scratch on a $ 1,500 macbook is unforgivable .####O O O O O O O O O O
i am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite , i like the extra features , i love the windows 7 home premium .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
what 's also interesting is this survey changed my ratings the first time i submitted it in case it does n't keep what i put here are my ratings####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
much of which hp ended up paying for .####O O O O O O O O O
a mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O
a little pricey but it is well , well worth it .####O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O
he has replaced his hard drive twice and ( of course ) has had to pay for antivirus software every year .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O

the book is useless .####O O O B-OP O
it is made better , thicker , and all out tough !####O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O

overall very impressed , thank you apple and amazon !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i took it back for a full refund .####O O O O O O O O O

i have had some excellent computer and have found i had no idea what to do with them####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could n't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
this a starter notebook .####O O O O O
in november my computer messed up entirely and would n't power on after installing a windows update , i had to have my hd flashed and lost everything on it , including my school assignments and irreplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason i was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history .####O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think that anyone looking for a good durrable laptop then this is the way to go .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i do not know for sure .####O O O O O O O
it also came with a built it web cam which is great because i can see an communicate with my family members back home .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
purchased a toshiba lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O
either the computer is too slow to detect the keys typed ( this is unlikely as i am a slow typist ) or the keyboard simply does not detect the keys being typed .####O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O
great product by apple with the new great looking design .####B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-OP O B-ASP O
this notebook restarts every time there is a new update , so if you do n't save your files and information , everything will be lost .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
i really do n't like it , but i am stuck .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
but we had paid for bluetooth , and there was none .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
it is everything i 'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
its only crashed on me one time in the 3 months i 've had it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
taking notes , research , an online class and such and did n't want to spend too much on my first machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
will certainly use macconnection again .####O O O O O O
a couple things you should know :####O O O O O O O
love the stability of the mac software and operating system .####B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
so do n't get it .####O O O O O O
its seen in movies , sitcoms , prominent important people carry and use them and they are great !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i like coming back to mac os but this laptop is lacking in speaker quality compared to my $ 400 old hp laptop .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
it has a faster processor and more ram .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
i am a wife , mom and a school teacher and a college student .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the macbook pro is the premier choice for college students .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
pay attention to the specs if you want these options .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
to my mind much more usable than the toy called an ipad .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
note , however , that any existing magsafe accessories you have will not work with the magsafe 2 connection .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
this laptop rocks ( only wish it could run solidworks cad - which apple does n't support ) !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other installed features , such as certain printer software , are also most attractive .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O
the aspire wont even boot past the acer screen with a droid ( i have tried both motorola and htc ) plugged into the usb port .####O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
they are about the same size keys .####O O O O O O B-ASP O
if this is an improvement in customer service then i would hate too see what it was before !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had nothing but problems since the day i took it out of the box !####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
never had a single problem , and do n't have to worry about viruses .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes , the computer was light weight , less expensive than the average laptop , and was pretty self explanatory in use .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the battery does n't last long but i 'm sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i would like to tell you about the best laptop i just got from mac .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
so buyer beware when buying toshiba####O O O O O O
i took the laptop home and not even a month later , i began to have problems with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this causes my wrist to scrape up against it .####O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm so disgusted that i wasted my money on this product .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O
i then upgraded to mac os x 10.8 " mountain lion " .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
hp said i had done the damage .####O O O O O O O O
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the 15 " macbook pro .####O B-OP O O O O O O
i saw the bad reviews from people saying to buy directly from apple and i was concerned but i took my chances and am overly impressed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
so what if the laptops/mobile phones look chic and cool ? the after sales support is terrible .####O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i have used a couple of others on the job as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i upgraded it 's ram to 2gb , i am very happy with it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it seems to have some options that are installed but do not work like i thought they would .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my macbook is so much better looking and so thin !####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O
apparently well built and gorgeous to look at , the i5 macbook pro is a winning combination of price and performance .####O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
waited on getting this computer , but it has been a great change .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
plain and simple , it ( laptop ) runs great and loads fast .####B-OP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O
hp refused to give me a new one and wal mart refused to take it back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was concerned that the downgrade to the regular hard drive would make it unacceptably slow but i need not have worried - this machine is the fastest i have ever owned ...####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
it is really expensive though .####O O O B-OP O O
we purchased this as a back up computer after our more expensive hp needed to be repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am going to college next year and i needed a cheaper , quality computer for the goals i am trying to pursue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 ) laptop still did not work , blue screen within a week ...####O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
the trackpad was easy to learn and navigate .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
customization on mac is impossible .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
very happy with my 7th toshiba laptop !####O B-OP O O O O O O
i was a little weary at purchasing another 13 " macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O
next , most acer laptop fans are on the bottom which is right on your laptop .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O
i was given a demonstration of windows 8 .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i will stack it up against laptops that cost twice as much any day .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
great battery life .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it blue screened on me without any warning , running simply basic chrome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the graphics are great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i bought this laptop and found its tab is not functioning .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
1st hand experience is very important , especially for a new customer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but , like i said before , the only reason i do n't currently have a mac laptop is because all of their laptops are too pricey .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only issue came when i tried scanning to the mac .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
the device speaks about it self .####O O O O O O O
i have found a lot of online sources to help me but think that i would have learned a lot quicker if i would have taken the class .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
screen is a bit glossy , but that 's not too bad .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
be safe buy a sony .####O O O O O O
easy learning curve .####O O O O
i finally decided on this one and could n't be any happier .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as usual at customer service center , she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague ( i could see them ) .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
another thing i might add is the battery life is excellent .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
i should have sent it back to them then .####O O O O O O O O O O
so when i had the money to buy one i bought other things instead ... a 700 laptop and some extra stuff with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have other computers that get strong signals that do n't drop in places that this " net " book loses its signal .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
just for a stupid cd .####O O O B-OP O O
if you had pc for four years i can almost guarantee that something would of gone wrong by now , maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
i 'm all for saving money but dell needs to step it up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had upgraded my old macbook to lion , so i kind of knew what i was getting , but had n't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
with all the programs that came with it , such as ilife and iwork , i was set from the very beginning .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
before we got this laptop , had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
the two of us use it regularly .####O O O O O O O O
the screen gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it 's very noticeable .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
i like it !####O B-OP O O
the track pad is a bit squirrely at times - sometimes too sensitive , and sometimes a bit unresponsive , but it 's usable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
the salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP O O O
ive never had a problem with it !####O O O O O O O O

the dell mini was the first dell product that i had ever purchased .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had my computer custom built from sonystyle.com .####O O O O O O O O O
it 's been time for a new laptop , and the only debate was which size of the mac laptops , and whether to spring for the retina display .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
its a dog plain and simple .####O O O O O O O
there is no hdmi receptacle , nor is there an sd card slot located anywhere on the device .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
no laptop is perfect , but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i called toshiba where i gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it does n't heat up like my old laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased a macbook pro and this to replace a couple of hp units that i was using .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this computer does everything i need it to do for school and more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the large screen gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or tv shows on your computer instead of buying an additional tv for your dorm room .####O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bluetooth was not there at all , and the fingerprint reader driver would be there , but the software would hang after installation was 1/2 way done .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
besides being elegant , the macbooks are durable .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O
i have vista , so i am unable to install and uninstall some programs .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
having a mac certainly makes life easier .####O O O O O O B-OP O
the tech guy then said the service center does not do 1-to-1 exchange and i have to direct my concern to the " sales " team , which is the retail shop which i bought my netbook from .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if this would be your first mac purchase then i would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between mac and pc 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's applications are terrific , including the replacements for microsoft office .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

i considered i may have too much on the computer , but after looking , there was plenty of space and that is not the issue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
boot-up slowed significantly after all windows updates were installed .####B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
however , the machine itself left a bit to be desired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the wheel that turns the volume up and down does n't work in real time .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
lightweight and the screen is beautiful !####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
accordingly , i have decided to never purchase another hp product ( my five year old compaq ) lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
it absolutely is more expensive than most pc laptops , but the ease of use , security , and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O

frustrated i hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still i think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
my first problem was with the pre-loaded norton firewall/security program .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

so , you can imagine how unhappy i am with this item .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
it is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good as new laptop but i am very satisfied .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O

when you look at the specs on apple products in comparison to a dell or a hp , yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O

i have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
the only thing that can be updated is the video , other than that you 're all set .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O

overall i feel this netbook was poor quality , had poor performance , although it did have great battery life when it did work .####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
from the start , when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even if you do n't do business , thats okay , it 's incredibly fast .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
either way the entire thing was just a joke , a complete rip off !####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
i really like the size and i 'm a fan of the acers .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O

i always swore by pcs and would never consider a mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
eventually we pushed hard enough to convince them that this was the machine that was causing the problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O

when i got my laptop back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then i started experiencing issues again , everything from programs and drivers failing again , to it powering off for no reason , to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
i would never buy a dell again .####O O O O O O O O
think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the shop , these macbooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and use it ( very clever con ) .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that is n't perfect about this netbook is the speakers , they are not loud at all but i expected that .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
i have had my dell latitude for almost three years .####O O O O O O O O O O O

my children wo n't even use it for their school work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
- i give up on my data , i just want a computer reasonably fast ...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i will also say it is much better than i expected !####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
being virus-resistant is a huge plus .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O
the keyboard feels good and i type just fine on it .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
i was told that it seems to be a multi - component failure .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cost is more as compared to other brands .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
the internet can be an scary place its up to you on what you do with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was considering buying the air , but in reality , this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient , even though it 's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
the screen is a little glary , and i hated the clicking buttons , but i got used to them .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
the built quality is really good , i was so happy and excited about this product .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O
i actually contact toshiba before i started having problem and was given run around after i supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
if you want more information on macs i suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the screen is gorgeous - yummy good .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O

and mine had broke but i sent it in under warranty - no problems .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
from the get-go , the m6809 was unsteady in its operation ;####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
the only thing i would change about it is the mouse keys .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it 's a great product for a great price !####O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
after doing extensive research , macconnection had the lowest price on the 15 " mbp i5 .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
in early may i got it back and this time i only had it back for 1 day before it had a new issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they " expedited " the repairs so i was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed , by a " senior tech " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
i took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and i finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the first problem is that the keyboard function is simply unsatisfactory .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
it is super fast , and always loads .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
now for the hardware problems .####O O O B-ASP B-OP O
no complaints for an apple product .####O O O O O O O
i have an iphone , and ipad , so it just made sense to finish off the platform by adding the mini .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality !####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O

works well , and i am extremely happy to be back to an apple os .####B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
long story , but after many calls to various offices , i was told that no one can override the depot and that managers do n't take phone calls or e/mails .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had it over a year now with out a glitch of any kind . . i love the lit up keys and screen display ... this thing is fast and clear as can be .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O
just bit the bullet and bought the mac hoping it will last a lot longer … .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't know why i did n't make the switch sooner ... o ya because it 's expensive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
windows also shuts the computer down for no reason without warning .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
it still heats up like mad and i am unable to use it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after all was said and done , i essentially used that $ 450 savings to buy 16gb of ram , two seagate momentus xt hybrid drives and an owc upgrade kit to install the second hard drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
so happy with this purchase , i just wish it came with microsoft word .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the nicest part is the low heat output and ultra quiet operation .####O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
no startup disk was not included but that may be my fault .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the great 18 month same as cash financing and advance protection plan which includes accidents like spills .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
amazing performance for anything i throw at it .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
the i3 processor does n't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O
mac also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free .####O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O
i worked in it retail sales before .####O O O O O O O O
very nice so far .####O B-OP O O O

i highly recommend that you buy this product .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
i would never tell anyone to buy one either .####O O O O O O O O O O
it discharges too quickly .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
plus it is small and reasonably light so i can take it with me to and from work .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , one of the users mentioned how the edges on the macbook is sharp , if you have money to spend on one of the incase shells , it does n't seem to be a problem .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i had purchased it from a major electronics store and took it to their service department to find out what the problem was .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
never been hacked .####O O O O
its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
i think this computer is super lame .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP O

i want the portability of a tablet , without the limitations of a tablet and that 's where this laptop comes into play .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is a bit quiet if you 're on a plane , this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
u can do what u want in just few seconds , even to start up your computer takes few seconds .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
this laptop is a great buy .####O O O O B-OP O O
but if you 're willing to pay another 200 dollar for a windows disc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i bought a cordless mouse for it , but do n't always take it out ;####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
my friends are in awe every time they come over !####O O O O O O O O O O O
screen - although some people might complain about low res which i think is ridiculous .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
- when battery life went to 4 hours or less , took it to the machouse amsterdam for repair ( 26th of august ) .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for this purpose , it 's great .####O O O O O O B-OP O
it is so much easier to use####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP
wonderful features .####B-OP B-ASP O
" this is n't a big deal , i have n't noticed the issue with dvds or other media , only through usb output .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
true quality at a great price !####B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O

keys stick periodically and i havent had the laptop for 45 days yet .####B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
nothing wrong with this computer at all !####B-OP I-OP O O O O O O
i got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced , so i was now on the second motherboard within 3 months .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i like itunes , the apparent security , the mini form factor , all the nice graphics stuff .####O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
after the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
my husband uses it mostly for games , email and music .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i cant believe hp put this out .####O O O O O O O O
again , the same problem , the right speaker did not work .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
without a big ol' clunky machine in my backpack , i feel like i can do programming homework anywhere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery has never worked well .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i work with kids and they love making short videos on there .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price , but you can not find the look , easy , applications , and the experience in mac .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O

but i was completely wrong , this computer is unbelievable amazing and easy to use .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
the only problem is that i had to add 1 gb ram , the computer was kinda slow .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
speakers do n't get that loud , but good enough .####B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
every time i log into the system after a few hours , there is this endlessly frustrating process that i have to go through .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i upgraded from a 5 year old laptop and was amazed to find out that this computer is much slower then my old laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i bought it for college and so far it 's amazing !####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
there is a blank lighted screen when i start and that is all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is probably an hour at best .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
3 ) horrible customer support####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
runs real quick .####B-ASP O B-OP O
i also wanted windows 7 , which this one has .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
i especially like the backlit keyboard .####O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
1 . you can not change your desktop background ( window 's 7 starter does not support that function ) .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O
after that the said it was under warranty .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i would buy this lap top over and over again !####O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a much more streamlined system for adding programs , using the internet , and doing other things everyone does on a computer .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the notebook pc , toshiba qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
garageband is easy to work with , like all the other apple applications i 've had experience with .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
this computer is exceptionally thin for it 's screen size and processing power .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
this machine delivers .####O O O O
apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience !####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
thus , when you carry it at a slanted angle , the screen will " topple " or " slide " down , if you understand what i mean .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
granted , it 's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops , my mac boots up noticeably quicker .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
also the keyboard does not light up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the baterry is very longer .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it made the computer much easier to use and navigate .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
the bottom-line is that this laptop just is n't worth it .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the sound is nice and loud ; i do n't have any problems with hearing anything .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
screen is awesome , battery life is good .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
the touchpad is very intuitive , so much so that i never want to use buttons to click again !####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
" i 've had it now about 2 months and absolutely love it .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
no luck , although i waited for hours on the phone-visited machouse , they stated the their call center is down due to too many phone calls ( difficult to believe ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i initially purchased my macbook pro 13 " in april , and i loved it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
adjust the sensitivity since it 's not that responsive to begin with .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O
another problem .####O O O
the screen takes some getting use to , because it is smaller than the laptop .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
but the machine is awesome and ilife is great and i love snow leopard x .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
if someone called me an apple fanboy it would make sense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the not so good , i got the stock screen - which is very glossy .####O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be gaming , otherwise the integrated intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
so we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it did n't work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
however , they were kind enough to send a replacement free of charge .####O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
could n't keep a page up you were working on !####O O O O O O O O O O O
i would buy one of these for every person in my office if i could .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer####O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
if you are looking for something reliable , this is the laptop for you .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
it is easy to use and lightweight .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
my last laptop was a 17 " asus gaming machine , which performed admirably , but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life , i found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome , not to mention that the asus had been slowly developing problems ever since i bought it about 4 years ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i fell in love with it .####O O O B-OP O O O
the other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes , the most common being a corrupted version of appleworks which can render the browser useless .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
, applications respond immediately ( not like the tired ms applications ) .####O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O
i would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
few viruses to catch ;####O O O O O
laptop was in new condition and operational , but for the audio problem when 1st sent for repair .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O

the volume is really low to low for a laptop was not expecting volume to be so low and i hate that about this computer####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O
the os is fast and fluid , everything is organized and it 's just beautiful .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O

i believe i purchased this in dec 09 for my primary work laptop which is used 5-10 hours a day , 4-6 days a week .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the so called laptop runs to slow and i hate it !####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O

i investigated netbooks and saw the toshiba nb305-n410bl .####O O O O O O O O O

i would rather spend my money on a computer that costs more than a toshiba that is n't good at all .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O

that 's very possible , but since they do n't make windows xp drivers for the sound card in this machine , i was stuck until windows 7 came out .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
that defeated the whole point of a laptop .####O O O O O O O O O
for the price and what i get out of it has exceeded my expectations .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i realize that not every unit has this issue , but the ones that do can not be repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did a lot of research and ended up thinking this toshiba was the best one for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me .####B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O
additionally , there is barely a ventilation system in the computer , and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the laptop to get very very hot , and in fact impossible to keep on lap .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O

maybe not the cutting edge ( satellite l455d ) but it is a workhorse .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership , so it was covered by the applecare warranty plan .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

but sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough ( this could be because im used to my lenovo 10 tablet now ) plus this is a great size if i want to unplug the external keyboard , mouse , and monitor to take it with me when i take photos and video .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O

the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , a netbook will be a different story .####O O O O O O O O O O

the dvd drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .####O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
no complaints with their desktop , and maybe because it just sits on your desktop , and you do n't carry it around , which could jar the hard drive , or the motherboard .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O
with today 's company fighting over market share , its a shame that asus can get away with the inept staff answering the phone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
not sure how i recommend it for quality gaming , as i have a desktop rig for that reason .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O

the only thing i dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O

the keyboard has a wonderful nature feel .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O
in desperation , i called their customer service number and was told that my warranty had expired ( 2 days old ) and that the privilege of talking to a technician would cost me ( " have your credit card ready " ) .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i sent it back and they lost it .####O O O O O O O O O
so not having my laptop was discouraging .####O O O O O O B-OP O
you just get a trial version either way .####O O O O O O O O O
the programs are great , like iphoto ( love the editing capabilities ) , imail ( which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad ) , imovie , etc .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O

after years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting computer viruses , a good friend convinced me it was time to go the apple route .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have the a65 - right now it 's a paperweight .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
while it was barely a bargin in the begining , i would never purchase another dell and would not recomend the dell brand to others .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
summary : they played games with me for the warranty period .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
somehow the system clock got messed up after reboot .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O
i had to call apple 19 times ( each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone ) , and take it to their store for evaluations , and diagnostics , 5 times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have never had any issues or problems with my macbook pro so far , and it is still as fast as it was when i first bought it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
really great ... well let me start at the beginning .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
also , in using the built-in camera , my voice recording for my vlog sounds like the interplanetary transmissions in the " star wars " saga .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
keyboard is great , very quiet for all the typing that i do .####B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the reality was , it heated up very quickly , and took way too long to do simple things , like opening my documents folder .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
other than that , i would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O
the program came with the computer and works beautifully .####O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O
oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive shipping to and from hp .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
i 've also had to have the keyboard replaced at my expense .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
and inconvenient !####O B-OP O
this laptop is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to install mountain lion and it took a good two hours .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O
and the multiple page viewer ( allows you to press one button to see every separate page currently opened at the same time in one screen ) are great for those who are working non stop or just shopping online .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
there is no need to purchase virus protection for mac , which saves me a lot of time and money .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
i did n't like one thing about it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
what can i say , it 's an apple .####O O O O O O O O O O
after much battling with hp i was able to return it 4 times for repairs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
did n't work when shipped from walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop ( same make/model ) .####O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the first time that i tried and owning a netbook although i have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years , i find not much difference except of course for the screen size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
after having two pc laptops die with in the past 3 years , i was led to the apple display at best buy by the sleek design and promise of less tech issues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
it is easy to use , fast and has great graphics for the money .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
i 've already recommended this laptop to a friend who eye 'd the computer when i took it out of my bag .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , i took it back to the apple store and they ( narcissist genius bar staff ) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
but the quality , in general was less than the worth of the cheap laptop .####O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O
i found this laptop on sale for under 6000 at best buy which was a great deal !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the awesomest of the awesomest .####O B-OP O O B-OP O
because he said that the hinge is under the motherboard and they have to dismantle the whole thing before it can be tightened .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am able to organize my pics , music and files easily .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it is easy to find documents , and keep them in one area .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
and i may be the only one but i am really liking windows 8 .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
does everything i wanted this laptop to do .####O O O O O O O O O
we upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O B-ASP O
oh yeah , and if the fancy webcam breaks guess who you have to send it to to get it fixed ?####O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this one has had the same effect .####O O O O O O O O
this is definitely a computer worth the money ;####O O O O O B-OP O O O
my only problem is i can not reg . the product key .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it had most of the features and all of the power that i wanted to replace my desktop machine .####O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
every day i had this computer , something failed on it .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
lots of preloaded software .####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
not a bad laptop , it 's a bit slow , but gets the job done .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i will not hesitate to recommend it to family and friends####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
it took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with notes saying they replaced the hard drive .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
do n't waste your money or time .####O O O O O O O O
i liked the aluminum body .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is my second macbook pro and it 's better than ever .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
2 . the wireless card is low quality .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O
the receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
it did n't come with any software installed outside of windows media , but for the price , i was very pleased with the condition and the overall product .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the computer was two weeks late in delivery because hp forgot to complete the required import paperwork .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
it does get hot when using on a bed or sofa and gets warm on a desk ... this is in an un-air conditioned room in air condition it gets slightly warm ......####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i expected so as it 's an apple product , but i was glad to see my expectations exceeded , this is the laptop to buy right now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
returned it .####O O O
i love the operating system and the preloaded software .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is my first dell i heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it !####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
it 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a notebook .####O O O B-OP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i shipped out on saturday , july 17 .####O O O O O O O O O
in all honesty , if someone is looking for a quality laptop and willing to pay a little more money for a normal sized laptop than a cheaper and less impressive laptop , then do not buy this computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never complain about the price since i believe you get what you pay for and my macbook pro was worth every dollar .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the speakers on it are useless too .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
i 've have n't had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the battery lasts as advertised ( give or take 15-20 minutes ) , and the entire user experience is very elegant .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
upon giving them the serial number the first thing i was told , was that it was out of warranty and i could pay to have it repaired .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i use it mostly for content creation ( audio , video , photo editing ) and its reliable .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
cheaper than buying it @ apple too !####B-OP O O O O O O O
it is amazing .####O O B-OP O
performance is much much better on the pro , especially if you install an ssd on it .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
it was a great laptop , ran great and was really fast .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP O
just a black screen !####O O O B-ASP O
my favorite by far , although the most expensive , was my sony .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
was searching online for a power supply when i found this site .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
we love the size of the screen , although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
i made a photo book as a gift , on my computer , pushed " buy " and it drew from my itunes account and sent the book to my house , the book was of perfect quality - exactly how i had created it and looked better than i had even imagined .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
was a great deal i will give that .####O O B-OP O O O O O O
the 13 " macbook pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to ca this is the best price we can get for a great product .####O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O
i have owned many computers and laptops .####O O O O O O O O

recommended to people as their first laptop .####B-OP O O O O O O O
but after using it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i grew up in a design family so it only made sense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints .####O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O
this laptop is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
three weeks after i bought the netbook , the screen quit working .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
it works !####O O O
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happening so hopefully we can get a new one very soon !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh my goodness - i am not a happy camper .####O O O O O O O O O O O
easy to carry , can be taken anywhere , can be hooked up to printers , headsets .####B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you might think , i am new in this game , but i am a gadget lover , and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years , and none gets this hot , that fast .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing is that the battery wo n't last more than 1/2 an hour .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
it is absolutely horrible to use , despite all its so called advanced features .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
kind of annoying , but i still love the laptop .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O
and it 's so quiet that i do n't hear it at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the display is awesome .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
consumer report recommended toshiba .####O O B-OP O O
it is so simple to use , i use it more than my desktop .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i purchased two laptops ( for my husband and 16 year old daughter ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this " never " happen ...####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a hard decision for me since the macbook pro looked so appealing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
fast , great screen , beautiful apps for a laptop ; priced at 1100 on the apple website ; amazon had it for 1098 + tax - plus i had a 10 % off coupon from amazon - cost me 998 plus tax - 1070 - otd !####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
if you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just buy the case and be happy , plus it looks nice , i bought the white one from best buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is amazingly long at 7 hrs and 5 hrs if you use it .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
while most people say that pcs hold functionality and value and macs are just pretty to look at , i think there 's something to be said about the simplicity of macs .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
the delivery was fast , and i would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is easy to use , its keyboard easily accommodates large hands , and its weight is fantasic .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
and it did n't show up on the reciept , i do n't know how we ordered it online !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
i am glad i did my research .####O O O O O O O O
the other day i had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town - lots of people , little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
perfect -- thanks so .####B-OP O O O O
by the way teachers , they offer a discount which helps !####O O O O O O O O O O O O

yet my mac continues to function properly .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
i have had the luxury ( sarcasm ) of owning 2 of these laptops .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mousepad is a huge pain in the arse !####O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
screen is bright and gorgeous .####B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
it was just one problem after another for me , and that 's reason we had forked out so much money was so we would n't have anything to worry about .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that being said after 2 weeks of owning every time i start it up now it gives me a black screen for 5-8 seconds stating pxe-e61 media test error check cable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that being said , it still runs video in full screen decently .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will not buy another one .####O O O O O O O

they transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you ca n't understand what they are saying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i bought a logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the mbp , but i use the touchpad 90 % of the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i am totally satisfied with my little toshiba !####O O O B-OP O O O O O
it pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i have owned it only two months !####O O O O O O O O
this is the first apple product that i have purchased .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it will be returned in the state to which it was shipped michigan .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my sister is the electronics manager at wal mart and she says that hp is the best .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features .####O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the new mbp offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't really have a complaint .####O O O O O O O O
the feel of this machine compared to the old macbook is far superior .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
but in fact it is totally the opposite .####O O O O O O O O O
it is much faster than my desktop which is a core2 quad running at 2.83 ghz .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i upgraded the memory and replaced the base windows 7 starter to win 7 home , and it runs just fine .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
enjoy your sit down####O O O O
i 've had this laptop for about a month now .####O O O O O O O O O O O
by the time i was finally able to get a work order to get it fixed i had been without my computer for almost a week while i was an online college student , so it was very inconvenient and i had to send it off and be without it while it was being fixed also .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
have returned that laptop unused .####O O O O O O
the shop will definitely push the problem to the service center .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
overall : poor , features : average , performance : poor , battery life : excellent , price value : poor####O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP B-ASP O B-OP
one more tip , please purchase this model and get a 4gb stick of ram to save you $ 10####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
do you think the shop will give me a new set ?? it will not !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a month later , we reinstall the os ( vista ) .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i am just amazed .####O O O B-OP O
i will never go back to windows !####O O O O O O B-ASP O
far superior to my macbook .####O B-OP O O O O
i had to re-install windows within two weeks of the purchase and soon discovered cracks in the screen hinges .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the black model also has a very nice seamless appearance - one of the better looking notebooks i 've seen .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O
boots up fast and runs great !####B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O B-ASP B-OP O
startup in about 30 seconds , shutdown in 2-4 seconds , resume from sleep in 0-2 seconds .####B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
i returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund .####O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is a lot of the software i have wo n't work with mac and iwork is not worth the price of it .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
it had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one .####O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
you can imagine that an expensive item as a laptop will not be left on your front steps , it needs signature to pove that you received it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was having a though time deciding between the 13 " macbook air or the macbook pro 13 " ( both baseline models , priced at 1,200 $ retail )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
acer was no help and garmin could not determine the problem ( after spending about 2 hours with me ) , so i returned it and purchased a toshiba r700 that seems even nicer and i was able to load all of my software with no problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
my macbook is probably the best investment i have ever made .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had windows 8####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP
it suddenly can not work .####O O O O B-ASP O
simple to use , and great graphics .####B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O
i give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
i 'm hoping the rest of the features will be the signature quality of apple .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .####O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i am now frustrated that i still have to use my work issued windows laptop !####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love everything about it .####O B-OP O O O O
i currently own a lenovo laptop as well as my new macbook pro , and each have their own strengths and weaknesses .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did not even have it a year .####O O O O O O O O O
the mbp i recieved was everything it should have been .####O O O O O O O O O O O
let 's just get this out of the way , i love apple !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great ( i even put it to the test by accident ) excellent innovation !####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i ca n't honestly say i was heartbroken .####O O O O O O O O O
in the short time of one month since the 2012 mac mini was released there are well over 1000 posts regarding this issue and the numbers keep rising .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the unibody design is edgy and durable .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
you will not regret it , promise you !####O O O O O O O O O
they sent out a sony ' certified ' technician .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
right size and weight for portability .####B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
tons of bloatware and junk programs .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i setup my password last night with the password on my other computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its fast and another thing i like is that it has three usb ports .####O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
in my house , hp is a nasty word .####O O O O O O O O O O
this is still a fairly good upgrade to a laptop that was about 4 years old .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you can afford a new laptop , and are in the market for one , of course , then definitely go for this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hope this helped !####O O O O
it is trash !####O O B-OP O
not too much " junk " software to remove .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
they would repair one thing , send it back and it would still have the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hope to edit this in the next few hours , i am going to try to install my own copy of windows 7 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
help , help , other than that gets a great little wonder .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a great computer .####O O O B-OP O O
i never tried any external mics with that imac .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
so glad i did not waste money on a less than par product .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the difference is it 's a whole lot of fun using the laptop now , still learning the apple navigation , but is fun and comes with a lot of cool apps .####O O O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP B-OP B-ASP O
the graphics are stunning .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
the apple pro notebook will not let you down .####O O O O O O O O O O
looking to take my video and photo editing to the next level , i decided to purchase the mbp 15in intel core i5 after reading consumer reviews as well as professional reviews of this laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the first one sent : touchpad did n't work the second sent : usb did n't work the third sent : touchpad did n't work the fourth sent : has n't arrived yet .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O
when i called toshiba , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $ 35 for the phone call , even though they did n't offer any technical support .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
my wireless provider confirmed my home internet is fine , and any connections i turn on should work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
this is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O

i have a laptop as my regular computer , but found that disconnecting it and lugging it around was a drag .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
suffice it to say , my macbook pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
it just works out of the box and you have a lot of cool software included with the os .####O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
the price is 200 dollars down .####O B-ASP O O O O O

and it fits in my briefcase with ease####O O O O O O O B-OP
since then i have had minor problems with slow operation .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
the only thing i wish is the 15 inch macbook pro has much better speakers on the side of the keyboard .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the upgrade .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O
you will not regret buying this computer !####O O O O O O O O
so if you move laptop a lot , it might get loose , however it sits pretty tightly .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O
besides the great look , it is a great machine .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O
i connect a lacie 2big external drive via the firewire 800 interface , which is useful for time machine .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
this is especially disheartening when apple prides itself as the choice of creative professionals .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
oh and if thats not bad enough it does n't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $ 25 for two cds .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price####B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP
the laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the windows 7 starter and not the full windows 7 .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
support has been lackluster and now i just want a refund .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O

let me start off by saying that i was highly reluctant to spend so much money on a laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the computer runs very fast with no problems and the ilife software that comes with it ( iphoto , imovie , iweb , itunes , garageband ) is all very helpful as well .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O

one suggestion i do have , is to not bother getting microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a pc .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the apple care has never failed me , and i expect it to be the same for this computer as well .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i like the lighted screen at night .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
how toshiba handles the repair seems to vary , some folks indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix , others had the repair done 5 times .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O

the screen is huge and colorful , but no led backlighting .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O
hp is more interested in selling extended warranties ( which cost more than the netbook new ) then they are in helping or fixing .####O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the macbook pro is really responsive .####O O O O O B-OP O

i will never buy another computer from dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how i was treated by the company .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O

do you think i purposely " destroy " my netbook , so that i can demand a new set ? do you think it 's fun to take public transport all the way to the service center and get a non-satisfactory solution ? or rather no solution .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O

for me i was lucky and a local store was selling them for $ 2000 off and best buy matched their price so i was able to buy one for under $ 1000####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
they claim that i should be happy because i am getting a new laptop to replace my two-month old laptop .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
believe me apple has a reputation .####O O O O O O O
i definitely suggest getting an extended warranty , you will probably need it !####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
size : i know 13 is small ( especially for a desktop replacement ) but with an external monitor , who cares .####B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
i let my friend borrow it , and she knows nothing about computers , and she used it with ease .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
thank you best buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software - you guys were great too !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O

the macbook is way too overpriced for something so simple and chaotic .####O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O B-OP O
it 's color is even cool .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
of course , emachines can not be made entirely to blame for this computer 's woes ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the [ $ ] price ( special offer ) this is a great laptop .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O
but , buy this model and just purchase 4gb of ram ( 2x2gb for $ 92 or 1x4gb for $ 99 ) , and save yourself $ 100 than the other model with 8gb of ram .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

bought it to use mostly for online classes .####O O O O O O O O O
i ca n't begin to say how disappointed i am .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O

they offer the best warranty in the business , and do n't 3rd party it out like toshiba .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sorry toshiba , but 1st impressions do count for something .####O O O O O O O O O O O
but for now , this laptop is still a workhorse .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's not a wear-and-tear issue , not due to user carelessness and most importantly , they ca n't guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and i have to accept the outcome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
