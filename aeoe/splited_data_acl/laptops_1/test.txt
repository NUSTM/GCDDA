so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

who could n't love a dvd burner , 80-gigabyte hd , and fairly new graphics chip ? as i soon discovered , though , there is a reason for which similarly-configured sony and toshiba machines cost more : they use higher-quality components that are faster , better-configured , and end up lasting a lot longer .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O

numerous problems over the next 3 weeks until i got the blue screen of death and had to send the pc back to hp .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the reason why i choose apple macbook because of their design and the aluminum casing .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
came with iphoto and garage band already loaded .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
they say that this will invalidate the warranty on the hard drive ( i do n't really understand why but anyway ) .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
as far as user type - i dabble in everything from games ( wow ) to photoshop , but nothing professionally .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
that whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $ 175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $ 175 and it was fixed .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but see the macbook pro is different because it may have a huge price tag but it comes with the full software that you would actually need and most of it has free future updates .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O

highly recommended !####O B-OP O
also , because of the size and consistency of the laptop computer , some websites would n't even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
my previous purchases were with dell and hp .####O O O O O O O O O

we paid for the three year warranty and the extended warranty after that one ended as well .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
i did n't want to buy a generic brand computer but it is really nice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it has many great programs , such as ilife , iphotos and others .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
the only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O
however , i may have inadvertently thrown out one of the batteries with the shipping carton .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i ' have had it for about a 1-1/2 and yes i have had an issue with it one month out of warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O
so , i thought why not give mac book pro a try .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has 3 usb ports , 1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i am very happy with my first mac .####O O O B-OP O O O O O
unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you ca n't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything about this computer is easy to use .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i like the design and its features but there are somethings i think needs to be improved .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the quality , engineering design and warranty are superior -- covers damage from dropping the laptop .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
now am very apprehensive about toshiba laptops .####O O O B-OP O O O O
the video card is great for media , and above average for gaming , but not a gamers first choice .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP I-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
i am however pleased that it is still hanging in there .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
needs longer lasting battery , more than 1 to 2 hrs .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
my one complaint is that there was no internal cd drive .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
the ease of use is wonderful .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
i can actually get work done with this mac , and not fight with it like my tired old pc laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i find it not to be very user friendly .####O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
while it was highly rated , would i like it ? i tried the keyboard at the store , and it seemed ok .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
i consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like how the mac os is so simple and easy to use .####O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
but then , something goes wrong .####O O O O O B-OP O
i needed a driver for my hp and they would not help me with out me paying over $ 50 for it .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've lived with the crashes and slow operation and restarts .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O
- stay away from apple , or hope you laptop does not break down .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have three words : piece of junk !####O O O O O O O O O
it has just enough ram to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
heck , if i had enough ' money , i would but it as a gift for someone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so it 's perfect for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O
after purchasing this thing , i find out that i need a special interface device to connect my camera , and that it can not be purchased at the store - only on line .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
clearly , there is something wrong with the product and lg did n't take up the responsibility .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
in those three years , i 've had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by apple quickly and easily .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O
also you may need to charge it once a day , if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O
although i do believe that windows operating system may be to fault for some of the problems .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O
i 've been having endless problems since i bought the computer - only 1 month ago####O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O

for the same price , you get a lot more in the asus .... 1920x1080 res .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
you will need them if you want to reload the os ( i recommend doing if you can to start fresh and optimal ) .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought it to be able to dedicate a small , portable laptop to my writing and was surprised to learn that i needed to buy a word processing program to do so .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O
the battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes .####O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it seems to be incompatible with everything else .####O O O O B-OP O O O O
aside from the trial software and the short battery life , lack of a webcam , its great .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
called tech support and got the usual acer " we do n't support software but for $ $ $ we can help you " i explained there was no software involved in booting .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
i really wanted a mac over a pc because i used a mac in high school .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am now making a point to avoid their products and i hope my experience can serve as a warning to you as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still i think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O
so honestly , i was n't expecting anything less than perfection , and i was n't disappointed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
the apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O

but i do n't see it as a problem .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
those things are very important - vital even !####O O O O O O O O O
and the fact that apple is driving the 13 " rmbp with the intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered ( to me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
i use it now more than i even thought i would .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
my life has been enriched since i have been using apple products .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O

most everything is fine with this machine : speed , capacity , build .####O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i would recommend not buying this product .####O O B-OP I-OP O O O O
- i propose that they can just swap the hard drives .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
price was higher when purchased on mac when compared to price showing on pc when i bought this product .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O

sure , the initial out of pocket expense is greater , but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet , and when i factor in all the money in that i wasted on geek squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested pcs , it probably comes out about even anyhow .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

apple is aware of this issue and this is either old stock or a defective design involving the intel 4000 graphics chipset .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O

my only other complaint is that it gets really hot .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the computer first started malfunctioning 3 months after purchasing it .####O O O O O O O O O O O

i think part of the problem with this computer is vista , yet i know vista is n't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my acer and it also has vista ( i should have waited the few months to get the next operating system ) .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
that 's right , no power , absolutely nothing .####O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O
i have used pc 's and converting to this macbook pro was easy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i have owned many different brands of laptops in my life .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the speed , the simplicity , the design . . it is light-years ahead of any pc i have ever owned .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it did n't take me long to get switched over to the mac computer programs and navigation - it 's been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
a key contributor that led me to mac is the art aspect .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones i have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music i suggest you get something better .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i re-seated the " wlan " card inside and re-installed the lan device drivers .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
but after i got used to it i love it .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
so you out of of notebook and money .####O O O O O O O O O
until i bought the dell , i thought you just looked for what you wanted ( size , software , options , hardware ) and purchase the best deal you could find .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O
i asked many people , search on the net and also read reviews here in best buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it did not have all the features i expected it to have .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i have found it very easy to use , very informative , wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O
it took so much time .####O O O O O O
then i 've fixed the dc jack ( inside the unit ) , rewired the dc jack to the outside of the laptop , replaced the power brick .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
with a mac computer i have more free time as i do n't have to wait for windows to boot up or shut down and all the viruses associated with windows .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O
so , i must say i am not a happy camper .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the price is higher than most lab top out there ; however , he/she will get what they paid for , which is a great computer .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
the benefits were immediate !####O O O O O
this is the third in a series of macbooks starting with a black macbook .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first of all yes this is a mac and it has that nice brushed aluminum .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my macbook pro works like a dream , it has never overheated , or even been slightly warm for that matter .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP O O O O
the notebook is lacking a hdmi port and a s-video port that would enable one to hook it to a tv .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O
take the simple , easy solution to your computer problems and stop waiting and smacking your old computer around .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this program , it is superior to windows movie maker .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i chose the ibookg4 , a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large screen big enough to please anyone .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP B-OP O O O O O
the display on this computer is the best i 've seen in a very long time , the battery life is very long and very convienent .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O
summary : spend your money elsewhere####O O O O O O
i 'm glad i bought this laptop , it was worth the few ( $ 100 ) extra dollars .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
sad very sad .####B-OP O B-OP O
i finally own a piece of computing equipment that i do n't want to take a baseball bat and destroy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i baby my electronics so i know for a fact it was defective and not anything that i did to it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
toshiba will not acknowledge this problem .####O O O O O O O
i needed something affordable from apple and was tired of dealing with pc laptop after pc laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought it to my son who uses it for graphic design .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what i need it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
handles all my basic media needs easily .####O O O O O O B-OP O
breaks easily .####O O O
it is also very lightweight , making transporting this computer very easy .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
apparently they 're not special anymore .####O O O B-OP I-OP I-OP O
it works great for general internet use , microsoft office apps , home bookkeeping , etc .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
there are no gold key numbers to install programs , you must use the serial numbers that it does not accept and then things are limited as far a working because they are only good for a short time .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is not even a year old yet , so i would definitely not recommend it to anyone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
made interneting ( part of my business ) very difficult to maintain .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
i was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews , but i 've found it fine to work with .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
best buy was great as always and accepted the return and gave me another model 1764 .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and these are some reasons you should get a macbook pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the cons are more annoyances that can be lived with .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i have always wanted a macbook pro always !####O O O O O O O O O
apple hit a home run here .####O O O O O O O
needless to say , the leap from that to this has been amazing and ( aside from the financial reasons ) i am astounded that i had n't made the switch sooner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
either way i 'm furious .####O O O O B-OP O
for two months , when you guessed it .####O O O O O O O O O
to those thinking about switching , do it and do not look back !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications ( ie internet tabs , programs , etc ) simultaneously .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
the case is carved out of a single block of aluminum .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
runs fast and the regular layout keyboard is so much better .####B-ASP B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
it 's not inexpensive but the hardware performance is impressive for a computer this small .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O
i think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
at $ 1899 to start , this is no cheap machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
enjoy using microsoft office !####B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i own a hewlett packard laptop and i 've had man problems with it since i bought in in feb , 201####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so if anyone is looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name toshiba on it ...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
got this for a graduation gift for my daughter for her to use at college .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen is bright and clear , the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O
which was way too much money .####O O O B-OP I-OP O O
the dvd burner broke after burning 3 dvd 'd during that time !####O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O
everything is falling apart internally and externally .####O O O O O O O O
if you 're not wanting to be mobile , this is a good laptop to sit on a desk .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
i could not handle it one hand like i can the replacement computer i purchased .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am going to go back and return at store i bought from !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also experience the same with my macbook air .####O O O O O O O O O O
they said that my computer was covered on an extended warranty , and that products with extended warranties are taken care of through third parties and not sony itself anymore .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
dismantle the whole thing ? then it will not be a newly manufactured set like before .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* if you are looking for a good laptop , this is not it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's not a recommendation , it ' a plea .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm tired of the inept service .####O O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O
the laptop preformed pretty well .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i also own an hp notebook and it does n't even come close .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
despite the claims of the apple apologists ( a vice of which i am recently myself reformed ) the internals of mac laptops are no different from pcs ' at this point .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i sit down and use my husband 's work pc and i do n't like it one bit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
so , after apple replaced the hard drive i enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer , until it froze this morning -- completely .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
and the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me ( i prefer it dark ) or if you can crank up the brightness .####O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it did fairly well , other than it 's poor performance , overheating and occational blue screen .####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O
the computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan .####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i will be returning it and switching brands when i get to best buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the first macbook i have ever had .####O O O O O O O O O O
vista is a nightmare .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
very disappointed with apple .####O B-OP O O O
just beware no dvd slot so when i went to install software i had on cd i could n't .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
it is very easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
and finally i realized that mac is the best .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
congratulations asus for creating one big piece of dump which is my laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you could stretch by a few 100 dollars i highly recommend you should replace your windows laptop with this one .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i was taught to use photoshop and was amazed .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
it was still working , but there was nothing on the screen .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
wasted me at least 8 hours of installation time .####B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
of course my warranty runs out next month .####O O O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O O
the brand of itunes has just become ingrained in our lexicon now , but keep in mind that apple started it all .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , it did not have any scratches , zero battery cycle count ( pretty surprised ) , and all the hardware seemed to be working perfectly .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
it is everything that i would want in a computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i like the design and ease of use with the keyboard , plenty of ports .####O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O
taking it back to best buy i found that a tiny plastic piece inside had broken ( manuf issue ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
i 'm glad i made the choice to switch and buy this mac .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
after numerous attempts of trying ( including setting the clock in bios setup directly ) , i gave up ( i am a techie ) .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is awsome !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the only thing i did n't learn in my research was the software i would need like privacy protection and warranty protection , in case it gets broken , or crashes etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O
i normally do n't participate in reviews/surveys but this laptop has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts ...####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
huge apple mac fan !####O O O O O
excellent in every way .####B-OP O O O O
they do n't translate from a mac , even on word , resulting in a ton of run-on sentences .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i got a mac as my hs graduation gift .####O O O O O O O O O O
the keyboard is top notch .####O B-ASP O B-OP I-OP O
it is easy to navigate and update programs .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i am using the external speaker - sound is good .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O B-OP O
was very much worth the price i paid .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
) i also tried the touch pad and compared it to other netbooks in the store .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
2nd mac book i have purchased from macconnection .####O O O O O O O O O
i hate this one .####O B-OP O O O
trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything , so i want to manage my time i do have to be the most efficient .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i believe with apple - you get what you pay for .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
they sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still did n't work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
it was a great deal after all .####O O O B-OP O O O O
this laptop is insane !!!####O O O B-OP O
being only 2 months old , i am not a happy camper !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this was purchased for my daughter and i was pleasantly surprised .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O
second , it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
system is loosing about 20 % of performance because of that .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O
i did add a ssd drive and memory####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP
now , i guess , i 'll have to unload my m6809 on some poor , hapless soul .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , the experience was great since the os does not become unstable and the application will simply shutdown and reopen .####O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the power plug has to be connected to the power adaptor to charge the battery but wo n't stay connected .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
it is easy to use , good quality and good price .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
do you ever think hp would do that ? never !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen graphics and clarity , and sharpness are great .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
speakers does n't sound that great .####B-ASP O B-OP I-OP I-OP I-OP O
i bought this laptop for my son in 2007 for his christmas present .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that was a big mistake .####O O O O O O
i wanted a computer that was quite , fast , and that had overall great performance .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
not super fancy , but not super expensive either .####O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O
the price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
there are a few flaws as well that i noticed .####O O O O O O O O O O O
while there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down , this occurs far less frequently than on pc computers and laptops that i 've used .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the most amazing part to me as a pc user is the startup and shutdown times - and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a pc .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i am pleased to report that it is one of the best presents i have received to date .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
bought the first asus laptop in san francisco , returned it in santa maria , thinking it was just a problem with that computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very happy with my purchase .####O B-OP O O O O
that system is fixed .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
it 's now all commodity hardware .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
plus two finger clicking as a replacement for the right click button is surprisingly intuitive .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
look up recipes and keep it on the kitchen counter while i cook .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this little one .####O B-OP O O O O
it gets stuck all of the time you use it , and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work .####O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
defective software .####B-OP B-ASP O
sure it 's not light and slim but the features make up for it 100 % .####O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
now i could get myself a cheap computer , that will probably work a whole lot better !####O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
if you have to ask you do n't own a mac and your just not in the know .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the keyboard is too slick .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the computer continued to give me issues and in late june it completely died again and i tried to call acer again to get it fixed and they refused to help me , they said my warrenty was up and hung up on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
he left me , instructions on what to do when this comes up , or that comes up ......####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , if you need to talk to a representative at microsoft , there is a charge , which i believe is robbery , since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system , which most people would have went with xp if they could .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O

the system constantly overheats , the battery life is too short , the case is coming apart , and my core applications that i use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly .####O B-ASP B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O

best thing is i can use existing 32 bit old programs .####B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
they ended up keeping my computer for almost 3 months !####O O O O O O O O O O O
i have loved this since i took it out of the box .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
everything about a mac is wonderful , it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system , but you will learn fast and its all worth it .####O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O B-OP O O
and now i am a proud macbook owner also !####O O O O O O O O O O
with the softwares supporting the use of other os makes it much better .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
at first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and i send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later i then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now i have to send it back again to get it fixed again .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would rate this computer at 5 stars , but considering it has a short life span i can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine .####O O O O O O B-OP I-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
excellent speed for processing data .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O
it 's the most wonderful thing in the entire world .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O
they replaced my hard drive as well as my mother board .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i have just had to learn to be a little harder typer than on my last computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i respond that i do not have the old computer and this way i would lose the data on my hard drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
even out of warranty !####O B-OP I-OP B-ASP O
we do n't mind and you do n't matter .####O O O O O O O O O O
i was not aware that this product can not display websites that contain flash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all you have to do is turn it on and it works .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my kids ( and dogs ) destroyed two power cords by pulling on them .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
packing and everything was perfect####B-ASP O O O B-OP
sadly apple has discontinued this macbook , i think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller pros .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i called technical support .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
my house is now 100 % macbook .####O O O O O O O O
so think about factoring those things in when you purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O
stupidly , mind-numbingly slow -- then i found it can only be loaded with 2gb * maximum * .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all i can say is w-o-w .####O O O O O O O

what i 'd like is for the laptop to run well without having to purchase additional memory .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
the best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once , it never slows down .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
whenever i call dell about an unrelated problem , they ask me if my laptop is running slowly and if i 'd like to purchase more memory for $ 75 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
but as time went on i found it almost impossible to keep the thing on-line through wi-fi .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

after they found no other way , they told me to courier it to them ( since they do n't allow the use of the post office ) at my expense , and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it would n't be covered .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
