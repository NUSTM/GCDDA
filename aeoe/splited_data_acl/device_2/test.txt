i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O
had this been my only dvd player , though , it would have been a real problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the dynamic playlists ( " now playing " , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate . . .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O
the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .####O O O O O O O O O O O
second , the " automatic " sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the light goes from red to green but no display or any operation whatsoever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can ' t , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hope the unit lasts as i 've only had it for 3 days .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pro : 1 .####O O O O
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
i am very pleased with its quality and durability .####O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
again had to remove the battery .####O O O O O O O
one still works fine , the other quit after one day .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of " now playing " interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
on several different occasions it has displayed " no disc " with a disc inside .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
the player 's mechanics are also flawed .####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
whatever you do , do n't buy this product .####O O O O O O O O O O
i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium ; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunatly it was dropped and damaged a year after i bought it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
really quiet .####O O O
this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) . . .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a great camera for you !####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O

difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say " difficult , " but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
the ipod 's white plastic look / surface does n't suit me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anybody can explain that ?####O O O O O

you can customize bass , etc. like usual , but also you can customize the sound of the player ( like how it would sound in a concert hall , jazz club , etc ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- uploading music is quick and easy .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O

imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on " normal " resolution .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .####B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-ASP O
this is my first digital camera .####O O O O O O O
the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .####B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
if you have a good digital camera , there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can ' t do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .####O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought an ipod and am very happy with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O
this can be done on a song by song basis or in mass .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great camera .####B-OP B-ASP O
i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we 'll see if i need them to .####O O O O O O O O O
what a disappointment .####O O O O
usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .####O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can ' t say much about the motorolla .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
usb 2.0 - very fast####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP
i bought this only to have it break within a month .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback . . . i can ' t recommend this product .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if this doesnt bring back the picture , try pressing this button without playing a dvd .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
originally i wanted the ipod .####O O O O O O
i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
as i travel quite a lot , i 'd want something with gsm as well as cdma tri-band .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft .####O O O O O O O O O O
yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 two different adapters -- ur-e 4 and ur-e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for ipod you have to buy a cable and it is n't compatible with all windows pcs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O
to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .####O O O O O O O O O O
i like the speakerphone function a lot .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
while you can create a temporary playlist , you can ' t store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is light weight , sleek and attractive .####O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
this camera will stay with me for years !####O O O O O O O O O
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
they piggy-back on cingular 's service .####O O O O O O O
we also looked at the fuji fps602 .####O O O O O O O O
you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now that i own it , however , i can ' t imagine being without it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it always pays off .####O O O O O
after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O
i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm compatible phone .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .####O O O O O O O O O
olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .####O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i can only hear the sound but no picture !####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :####O O O O O O O O O O
besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it looks great - and is loaded with features .####O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
features that would have been nice :####O O O O O O O
although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
reason for two ?####O O O O
i read reviews , compared specs , and visited user forums .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

so , without further adoo .####O O O O O O
i have had great experience with amazon , but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it worked .####O O O
so then i came across the ipod ( 10 gb ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
they said it is in stock , but they are " too busy " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display " lens " when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O O O O

hope to get my refund in a timely manner .####O O O O O O O O O O
i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-ASP O
one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it works great .####O O O O
what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox . . .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you 're talking totally different hardware .####O O O O O O O
i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling , but definitely more functional device .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with our compact 35 mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lot 's of other features that i need to find out about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm really happy with this purchase .####O O O O O O O O
it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP I-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
all in all suprisingly easy to use .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .####O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O
if i had to do this again , i might get the 40gb zen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you do take your chances with this phone .####O O O O O O O O O
this is ridiculous .####O O O O
so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
i 'd like to see my old carrier do that !####O O O O O O O O O O O
i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation .####O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
their customer service is very poor .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .####O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
the software , which comes with player is not good at all .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie " extras " on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wish i could give negative stars !####O O O O O O O O
so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far not going to get a good review .####O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall i like it .####O O O O O
i had no problems following their installation instructions .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28 mm filter set .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O O
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can ' t get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .####O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one stopped working in february and the other in march .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile " hot-spots " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i had hoped this was bought from walmart so that i could return it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't think so .####O O O O O O
i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time . .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O
manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
so far the software for the pc works easily .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O
it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was told that it is no longer available , so there must be something really wrong with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
word ... peace in the east bruvah .####O O O O O O O O
seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 ) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability ( the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio , home receiver , etc. )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lastly , the price is fantastic :####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into " out of battery " situation .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was impossible to do so before .####O O O O O O O O
do n't buy this player .####O O O O B-ASP O
it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
let me quote a customer service rep from one of the authorized apex service locations in my state ( they only service apex tv 's , not dvd players ) :####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life on this phone is surreal .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O
that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O
cheaper in every way .####O O O O O
the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i repeat - do n't wast your money .####O O O O O O O O O
they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , i highly recommend this phone .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you can not make changes on the ipod that are premanent .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
however , it serves its purpose .####O O O O O O O
i can ' t simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it would just spin up and stop , and display " no disc " .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O
you can also search for your song , which is good .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
carry your entire collection !####O O O O O
some dvd 's i rented would not play .####O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O
the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6-8 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the " # " key instead .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O
the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high speed internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O
proven canon built quality and lens .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is not a player you can take jogging .####O O O O O O O O O O
another point of note : the battery life is incredible !####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp .####O O O O O O O O O O
i applied a $ 25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying $ 29 for this machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this for my dad for christmas .####O O O O O O O O O
i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com .####O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O
the case had ad2600 .####O O O O O
the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also the ipod has games on it .####O O O O O O O O
do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .####O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O
maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the money , get a better quality player .####O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8-1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res . , with good resolution .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
i took the camera and just gave it to someone .####O O O O O O O O O O O
we did n't get to use it again for over a month ( sad , i know ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and we all know about the rush to market on new products .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod & avoided the zen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's not a big deal for me .####O O O O O O O O O
it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now i may buy two !####O O O O O O
in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O
called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O
controls easy yo use and easy to get to .####O O O O O O O O O O
and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O
it suppose to play everything .####O O O O O O
- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .####O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- very long-lasting battery life####O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
when talking the voice is not very clear .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .####O O O O O O O
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .####O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . .####O O O O O O O O O
i should n't have been cheap , should have bought a toshiba .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations .####O O O O O O O O
that is a very nice feature .####O O O O O O O
yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O
and those songs mostly are 320 kbps .####O O O O O O O O
i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
i liked this one enough to buy another .####O O O O O O O O O
although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that takes up half the space of mp3 's .####O O O O O O O O O O
it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .####O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
still , had to send it back to nikon for repair .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
warning - i did read the manual !####O O O O O O O O
so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and also , it 's priced very affordably .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great features . .####O O O O
i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery , so it 's good to go on a long vacation .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
those used to 35 mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
the light auto-correction is awesome .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
fm receiver - it has none .####B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
no go on most formats .####O O O O O O
to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
keeps coming up with no disk errors .####O O O O O O O O
well to say , i had a very bad history with players .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 battery has to be removed to recharge .####O O O O O O O O O
those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this to replace an expensive ( $ 300 + ) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have used this phone for two months now .####O O O O O O O O O O
vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP O
i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and have returned both .####O O O O O
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had this dvd player for about 3 months now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i paid twenty dollars more than the current price , and even then it was a steal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .####O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O
i bought this last week through amazon .####O O O O O O O O
truly , i am quite impressed . . ! !####O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately it turns out to be the " disposable " type .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O O O
i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds .####O O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the good news is if you can ' t get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
spend the extra 20 $ and buy a name brand dvd player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
save yourself some aggrivation .####O O O O O
it will not load any further songs on and customer service has no idea what to do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .####O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
spend the money its well worth it .####O O O O O O O O
it 's going back today , &#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .####O O O O O O O O
best electronic i 've bought since i was born .####O O O O O O O O O O
bait and switch .####O O O O
my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it lasted about 1-1/2 weeks .####O O O O O O
the g3 looks like a work of art !####O O B-ASP O O O O O O
overall , a good buy for the price .####O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O
you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the volume .####O B-ASP O
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .####O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 ) a spare battery would have been great .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
they told me i would have to connect to my laptop , which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it only took about 30 minutes to download everything , and that was about 950 songs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
third , the poor design continues with the case .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O
i got an rma from creative , sent my player in to them for repairs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .####B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this thing plays everything i feed it .####O O B-ASP O O O O O
i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .####O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
. lens cap is a really annoying####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP
it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to " get into " it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is small .####O O O O
even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-OP B-ASP O
it 's horrible .####O O O O
i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .####O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O
so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is pretty cool .####O O O O O
i would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35 mm .####B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O
while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O
i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .####O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
what more can you ask for from a $ 40 dvd player ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a great deal in general !####O O O O O O
after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP O
nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anyway , im gon na go find dennis now , have a nice day ! ! !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after two weeks the picture kept freezing .####O O O O B-ASP O O O
the battery life is amazing .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
gee ... thanks a lot creative .####O O O O O O O
now let 's talk about the software .####O O O O O O O O
buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O
1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
let 's face it - when you want to watch a movie you want to see a picture .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am still trying to resolve the problem with the second one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now , for the t-mobile service :####O O O O O O O
mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
took hundreds of pictures and they were great .####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O
before they are sold out !####O O O O O O
it 's money down the drain .####O O O O O O O
over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O
press the p/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O
games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
highly recommended .####O O O
navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can ' t do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .####B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i hope i have helped you continue to enjoy the apex dvd player with these troubleshooting tips .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- no propietary headset jack####O O O B-ASP I-ASP
if you have a lot of those , be prepared to convert to mp3 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'll probably also get the wide-angle now , too .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !####B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
you have to buy better ones .####O O O O O O O
as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hopefully you still have the remote control .####O O O O O O O O
everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
* sigh .####O O O
yes , the features are numerous .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
otherwise feedback seems to be good .####O O O O O O O
the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120 , the rio karma , and the philips hdd100 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i 'm screwed .####O O O O O
finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .####B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O
third party software to the rescue####O O O O O O
but for what i do use it is perfect .####O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .####O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .####O O B-OP O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if the casing of the player is this bad , i can ' t image that the hardware is of very good quality .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can only hear the sound .####O O O O O O O
we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
i spoke to a rep. at apex and was told that a new format is being used and we wont be able to view any disney movies made in the last couple months .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but can not be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great camera , and for the price you can ' t beat it .####B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O
so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O
there should have been a recall on this product .####O O O O O O O O O O
one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech . support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
it is a bit cumbersome , and i can ' t get to the songs i want as quickly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
controls are a bit awkward .####B-ASP O O O B-OP O
am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !####O O O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O
or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh well . .####O O O O
to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , the ad-2600 does n't have this feature ( for now ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do not recommend .####O O O O
structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
granted this is cheaper than an ipod .####O O O O O O O O
the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O
2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O
- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O B-OP O O O
the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
so consider what you 're going to use the device for .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the included memory card is too small .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after having bought and been disappointed in another brand of dvd player , i purchased the apex ad2600 from amazon and first of all i should say it was delivered much more quickly than i had expected .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you can get this phone for cingular or at & t , go with the other carriers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O
it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
get one now !####O O O O
every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm very glad i did .####O O O O O O O
i think a $ 39 dissapointment is better then a $ 125 dissapointment !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O
2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think this is it 's biggest flaw .####O O O O O O O O O
* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ) .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .####O O O O O O O O
it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O
now i can transport files to friends house with ease .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage####O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .####O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O
and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the " rigor " of a business traveler .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .####O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O
it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- outstanding signal reception####O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP
i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O
it is made of plastic .####O O B-ASP O B-OP O
most of these " annoyances " , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
more downside to this phone ?####O O O O O O
the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O
i listened to it for several days before needing to recharge them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk . i love the aiff , progressive scan feature .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O
if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just make sure the keys are locked .####O O O O O O O O
if you are planning to buy that player , do not !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i treat the battery well and it has lasted .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O
6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the camera has a wonderful set of features .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O

now i dont have to lug around 80 cds if i dont know what i 'm going to want to listen to biking home .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just get some new headphones and your set .####O O O O O O O O O
just be aware of it .####O O O O O O
the software is great .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it " unnecessary " and " so 20th century " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .####O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .####O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O
it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .####O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP B-ASP O B-ASP O
i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O
i was a little disappointed in the low end .####O O O O O O O O O O
once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought the player this week and i like it by far .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O
i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .####O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !####O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP O

lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
there have been other occurrences of locking , but i will not bore you with the details .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that is where my satisfaction ends .####O O O O O O O
before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i highly recommend this phone to anyone .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i am returning the broken one today .####O O O O O O O O
im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pass this player up , and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you want to be a poser and follow the herd , mooooooh , then buy the i-pod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had it lock up after a transfer of music .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
in a quick summation , here is what i found .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when i hit " menu " it told me , " playback only . "####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is not the same thing as a film camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O
in general it is easy to use and well laid out .####O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i find this to be a great feature .####O O O O O O O O O
you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can sort your music by artist , title , album , or genre , and you can play music based on those categories .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .####O O O O O O O O O O
this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O
flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $ $ $ ... and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .####O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O
i purchased it at a retail store , and got an extended warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album , artist , song title , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .####O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O
will never purchase apex again .####O O O B-ASP O O
repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone " unlike the nokia 3650 " and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ...####O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it took several days of attempts before things finally " worked " again and i have n't a clue why .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall i like the unit .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .####O O B-OP O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O
this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .####O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after fiddling around with it for a while , i notice a few dissapointments :####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds . even though they were not damaged in any way .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the reception and sound quality are top-notch .####O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O
all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i tried called apex cust service , no help .####O O O O O O O O O O
or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service from t-mobile is very good too .####O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O
if i 'd been paying attention , i would have noticed the 3 month warranty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as i travelled internationally and did n't want to haul it back on a plane with me it was an expensive addition to the recycling bin .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question .####O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well####O O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP
80 % of the features on here you will not get by spending $ 100 on a sony or panasonic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search function is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .####B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by the way , it looks nice also .####O O O O O B-ASP B-OP O O
the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O
if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , very light and portable .####O O O O O O O
i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the speakerphone :####O O O
bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the other controls are all very easy to use .####O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .####O O O B-ASP O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O
it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
good quality video .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
cons summary :####O O O
i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once again , the sound is awesome , the batter life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .####O O O O O O B-ASP O O O B-ASP O O O O O
i 'd have given it 5 stars , but i 'm waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one :####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other than that this thing is great ...####O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O
this is a powerful piece of equipment .####O O O O O O O O
- solid , high-quality construction####O B-OP O B-OP B-ASP
you can get a pretty good progressive scan sony or toshiba now for 68 bucks just about anywhere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
+ screen was good , easy to read####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .####O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O
after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O
it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .####O B-ASP B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev . machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .####O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O
it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
definetely a great camera .####O O B-OP B-ASP O
and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .####O O B-ASP O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed .####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O
i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O
radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpiece in .####B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O
i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .####O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had apex regular ( non-progressive ) dvd-player for two years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was no problem for me to use their software .####O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need :####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , if you 're an audiophile , you 'll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed , i would rate this a 5 star machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O B-OP O O O O
the quality is superb .####O B-ASP O B-OP O
but for now this will do .####O O O O O O O
the software has n't been a hassle for me at all .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .####O O O O O O O O O O
2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O
- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O
eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the distortion is not a flaw .####O O O O O O O
try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
want the laundry list of reasons why ?####O O O O O O O O
i have no complaints with this mp3 player .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O
simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O
i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and really this is the best phone one could have .####O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .####O O O O O O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O O B-OP O
amazon was supposed to send me another one , but did n't and sent me a gift certificate instead ( i 'm guessing because the price has gone up on this unit since december ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an " outlet environment " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .####O B-ASP O B-OP O O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP O
having said that , this is what you do . " add to cart " !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've yet to be dissappointed .####O O O O O O O
i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .####O B-OP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O B-OP O O
i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so what ?####O O O
i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .####O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP B-OP O O O B-OP O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but that 's a moot point now .####O O O O O O O O
it wo n't play all of my movies .####O O O O O O O O O
when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary . . .####O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have an apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking####O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O O O O
the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O
first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sold in other parts of the world :####O O O O O O O O
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
who cares if it does n't have multiple slots ?####O O O O O O O O O O
started ripping and transferring .####O O O O O
get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3 lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a few things that might make it even better :####O O O O O O O O O O
nothing but hassle with this company .####O O O O O O O
i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O
if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O
the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack .####O O O O O O O O O O O
when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .####O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-OP O O
what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
have had the player since xmass and love it !####O O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O
this problem vanished after the first month , so i assume it was a temporary dust issue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .####O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O O O O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?####O O O O O O O O O O
the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
somewhat disappointed that i could not " hook up " to my sony multi brand remote commander .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .####O B-ASP O B-OP O B-OP O B-ASP O
there was neither picture nor sound .####O O O B-ASP O B-ASP O
it is a very amazing product .####O O O O B-OP B-ASP O
me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O B-OP O O B-ASP O O B-OP O
had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O
but they offer only a 3-month warranty ( on all of their players , including the zen xtra ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can always spend more money to get a better one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .####O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display####O O O B-ASP O B-OP O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O B-OP O
* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .####O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O
only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .####O O O O O B-ASP O O O
i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well that was not a simple task .####O O O O O O O O
the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
loved the slim design .####B-OP O B-OP B-ASP O
when it arrives , you press the shutter release .####O O O O O O O O O O
i 've got 1200 songs on it now and about 4000 more to go .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .####O B-ASP O O B-ASP O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O
it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .####O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O B-OP B-ASP O
when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture !####O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O B-OP O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O B-ASP O
the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .####O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O
fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .####O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O B-ASP I-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are not wowable good .####O O O O O O
i bought the apex ad-2600 dvd player for the family for christmas .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it 's a " worldphone " and can be used in europe , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has a classic design yet looks hip .####O O O B-OP B-ASP O O O O
the radio feature has superb sound quality .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O
the menu options are uncreative , as you can ' t see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .####O B-ASP I-ASP O B-OP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i just put it on " shuffle " , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bought one for $ 49.99 .####O O O O O O
after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i enthusiastically recommend this camera .####O O B-OP O B-ASP O
i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the price is way below an ipod of the same size .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .####O O O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O O O B-OP O B-ASP O O
here 's why :####O O O O
the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ASP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
interface - practically seamless .####B-ASP O O B-OP O
simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .####B-OP B-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP I-ASP I-ASP O B-ASP O O B-OP O B-ASP O B-ASP O B-ASP O
i 've been using it for about 3 months now .####O O O O O O O O O O O
